The joropo encloses in the fandango its Afro-American origin with small indigenous contributions. The first fandangos arrived in Caracas at the beginning of the seventeenth century, they were played in the evenings of the great cacaos in the capital&#39;s haciendas and were performed with instruments such as the bandurria, the instrument, the harpsichord and the bandola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Etymology:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The word &quot;joropo&quot; comes from the Arabic &quot;xarop&quot; which means &quot;syrup&quot; and is related to the Mexican syrups from Guadalajara. There are those who say that the joropo is a Caribbean voice; likewise, there are people who maintain that it comes from Quechua.</p>",

The song of the history of the joropo expresses stories in verse about daily aspects of the life of the llanero; songs with various alterations in the tones and where flamenco songs are remembered.</p>",

People from the locality or people coming from various places, generally attracted by commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>",

In the first instance, the harp was an instrument used in churches and for private concerts in the houses of the rulers. Thanks to the Jesuits themselves, they decided to teach music to their congregants. The harp spread to the plains areas.</p>",

It is a plucked chordophone consisting of four strings. This is variety of the archaic four-stringed vihuela or Latin guitar, but in a larger box. It is traditionally used in joropos, passages and llanero airs instead of the current harp, since the classic organology of the llaneros was composed by bandola, cuatro and capachos. According to Carlos Rojas, the bandola llanera is a melodic guitar with four strings, two of which (the third and fourth) are made of metal and the other two of nylon. With a flat back and pear-shaped, traditional models have a short neck or fingerboard with only seven frets; modern versions, while maintaining the short neck design, present, in the manner of the Spanish guitar, frets embedded on an extension of the fingerboard on the soundboard. It is played with plectrum or pajuela, held between the thumb and index finger, combined in some segments of the piece with very percussive plucking of the first string called jalaos, made with the nail of the middle or ring finger and that are a form of response to the bordoneos (melodic songs implemented in the low register). Other common forms of execution are the segundeo (descending rasgueos) and the trapeo (rasgueos asordinados). The new generations of bandolistas also use melodic ornamentations such as the trill (tr&eacute;molo) sometimes played over the whole group of strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This type of archaic Hispanic lute, whose history in the llanera region is unfortunately very little documented, was rescued from an almost extinct tradition around the middle of the 20th century and has reached in recent years a remarkable virtuosic development that has led it to become the only melodic guitar in live use in the current joropo. It is a consubstantial instrument of the &quot;recio&quot; style joropo (with an accelerated tempo and great rhythmic vivacity), and is used in the interpretation of &quot;golpe&quot; and &quot;pasaje&quot;.</p>",

Its peculiar tuning is not totally ascending, it is small in size and owes its name to the number of strings it has. It should not be confused with the current Puerto Rican cuatro of five orders and ten metallic strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roots:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It has very remote origins. Similar instruments appear in Iranian and Cretan engravings in ovoid and square shape. In the year 3.000&amp; B.C., similar instruments are found in Egypt, derived from Chaldean-Assyrian instruments. The Arab lute or thimphle, through the Moorish invasions, arrived in Spain at the beginning of the 16th century with four orders, where it adopted a new shape, less oval and more similar to the current one, in the shape of an &quot;eight&quot;. Later, Maestro Salinas -Maestro de capilla of the Catholic Monarchs- added the fifth string and Vicente Espinel -who established the current strophic form of the tenth string- added the sixth string at the beginning of the XVII century (known as bordon or espinela) giving origin to the Guitar. The lute arrived in the Canary Islands, until it became the timple. This would be exported to America and the Caribbean with the Conquest of America, giving rise, many years later, to the versions known today in South America. The Puerto Rican cuatro, however, bears more resemblance to its ancestor the lute than to the timple of the Canary Islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also known as the cuatro llanero or traditional cuatro, it is an inseparable part of typical llanera music ensembles, along with the llanera harp (or bandola, as the case may be). It usually has an accompaniment function, although it can also occupy a soloist position, as a concert instrument, in some cases (usually outside the scope of the aforementioned llanera music).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is normally played strumming the strings with the right hand and making the chords with the left hand. The standard tuning does not allow many exits from this scheme, so sometimes it is necessary to change the tuning to reach new melodic possibilities, as in the case of the cuatro soloist.</p>",

In the Llanos they are used as accompaniment to the harp and the cuatro in joropo ensembles. The player is known as maraquero. Despite the simplicity of the instrument, the maracas llaneras have achieved an impressive technique of syncopations and contratiempos at high speed. In some regions the player also sings.</p>",

These musical expressions developed during the colonial period with influences from Baroque music and inter-oceanic trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until the middle of the 20th century, and as far as the plains region of Venezuela and the Eastern Plains of Colombia are concerned, the word joropo referred to a social event -almost a fair- lasting from a few hours to a whole week. People from the locality or people coming from various places, generally attracted by commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is also an instrument, although it is on the way to extinction due to lack of players, such as the CIRRAMPLA, which in the time of the violence of the fifties was the only instrument used at night to lull the llaneros to sleep during those difficult times in the Colombian country.</p>",

The number and type of mandolin strings has varied over time and place, but today the predominant configuration is that of the Neapolitan mandolin, with four double strings tuned like the violin (G-R-A-E).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The mandolin strings are usually plucked with a pick or plectrum, fingers may also be used. The soundboard may be concave or flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roots:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you&#39;ve ever seen a country band playing live, you may have noticed someone playing what looks like a small guitar. That instrument is, in fact, a mandolin. The mandolin is a musical instrument in the lute family. It generally has four courses of double metal strings, for a total of eight strings, which are tuned in unison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Throughout the following millennia, this instrument would be called by many names, before being called the lute. This instrument traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East. In a 14th century painting, a miniature lute is depicted by an angel. This instrument is called the mandola, by the Latins. The Italians, on the other hand, called this instrument the mandolin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When European immigrants began arriving in North America in the 19th century, they brought the mandolin with them. Due to an interest in strange or exotic things, the mandolin became a popular instrument. The mandolin was popular during the 1850s as a novelty that entertained the middle class. In the late 19th century, there was a surge of Italian immigration that further popularized a version of the mandolin. this instrument would remain popular well into the 20th century, and at one point factories were mass producing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The mandolin in the 1940s</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">By the 1940s, the mandolin, along with the banjo and guitar, had become popular among middle-class youth on college campuses in the American South. During this time, musicians were more experimental in the way they used the instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a result of this experimentation, new styles of playing emerged, some of which were influenced by techniques that are more closely related to the guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the llanera music has been making a comeback since some time ago, with some interpreters and due to its particular sonority.</p>",

These musical expressions were developed during the colonial period with influences from Baroque music and inter-oceanic trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until the middle of the 20th century, and as far as the plains region of Venezuela and the Eastern Plains of Colombia are concerned, the word joropo referred to a social event -almost a fair- lasting from a few hours to a whole week. People from the locality or people coming from different places, generally attracted by the commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>",

In the plains the term periquera also means heated discussion, quarrel or fight. It has been pointed out that after the battle of La Periquera the army of Paez celebrated with a joropo and because of this La Periquera is a type of joropo used especially for the accompaniment of the contrapunteo and can be performed between two or more singers improvising couplets on a certain theme or argument that is often used for the contrapunteo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The name of the &quot;golpe&quot; may be due to a jocular correlation established by the llaneros between the song of the wild parakeets and the song of the &quot;golpe&quot;, characterized by a high-pitched voice and a rapid syllabic phrasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Regarding the origin of the name, other opinions point out that this blow, which they say was Bolivar&#39;s favorite and that Paez executed it very well, was an air dedicated to Periquera, a hamlet located on the right bank of the Sarare River from which the current Guasdualito was constituted. It is also said that the village took its name from the hustle and bustle of parrots, macaws and parakeets, which abounded on the banks of the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also known as Juana Guerrero and Mocho Hern&aacute;ndez, due to some texts sung about this piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Sound element:</strong></p>",

For Colombia it is known that it was composed by Mr. Pedro Francisco Vivas, a musician from Casanare, between 1900 and 1910. This rhythm is one of the oldest rhythms according to oral tradition, and is better known in its instrumental form than with lyrics. The harmonic structure of this rhythm is divided into two parts A and B, and is played in a por corrido system. Part A uses the degrees (I, I, I, I, I, I, V7, V7, V7, V7, V7), and part B (V7/IV, IV, I, I, V7, I).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound element:</strong></p>",

The imaginary has also been constructed in relation to a territory far from the cities and associated with great difficulties of access, to gigantic extensions of wastelands and to all sorts of mestizo cultural practices where the joropo, dance, song and a strong oral culture are some of the most representative characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The expansion and flourishing of cattle ranching in the Colombian Orinoquia since the 17th century was possible, in large part, thanks to the possibility of bringing large livestock productions to the areas of consumption by means of a network of cattle trails. &quot;During the New Granada, while large herds were established on the Atlantic coast, Tolima and the Magdalena plains, livestock, roads and meat consumption defined the economic vocation of the Eastern Plains&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The work of the cowboys who dedicated their lives to this work and to the development of this trade was also essential. Since then, the roads that were opened or that, being indigenous roads in pre-colonial times, were adapted for the herding of cattle have been fundamental, thus connecting the different estates and herds with nearby populations, as the practice of cattle ranching grew and techniques were developed to adapt, guarantee survival and transform the environment. &quot;In rural societies, the road networks that connect the territory continue to be used frequently despite the development of roads. Roads, despite their progressive abandonment, articulate social relations, practices and meanings&quot;. Colombia owes much of its development, communication, and construction of its nation territory to the trade of muleteering, cowherding, mules, horses, cattle trails, mule trails, and roadside inns.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is reference to something similar to &quot;plain work&quot; towards the end of the 16th century; that is, only a century after the Spaniards had arrived in America, this activity was already foreshadowed. It seems that the work of the plains (domestication and management of cattle) has to do with a need that is more related to the demands of the environment and a wild context that demanded the development of techniques to domesticate both maroon cattle and horses and the development of knowledge of nature and various technologies, than to a simple inheritance or learning of a model derived from the Jesuit herds, as many cowboys state in their stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before there was the concept of ownership of land, there was the concept of ownership of cattle and, based on the ownership of rodeos or the number of head of cattle, the common right of use was granted or claimed, and later (when fences were built), on the possession of the land. This was given in the beginning by customary laws that were consolidated through something socially accepted by the ranchers or owners, which became the&nbsp;maximum expression of the repressive colonial legislation around the year 1811, sanctioned as &quot;the laws or ordinances of the plain&quot; in the state of Gu&aacute;rico and that later would extend throughout the entire Colombian-Venezuelan Orinoquia. The laws or ordinances of the plains were then implemented in different places of this territory since the beginning of the 19th century, but they had already been prepared for more than a century by the Jesuit herdsmen, who carried out a powerful pedagogical work and prepared the minds of the Creoles and mestizos since the end of the 17th century. Through these laws it was established, among other things, that the ownership of land would eventually be granted only to those who had cattle and in an amount corresponding to the size of their herd; in this way, as we see today, the richest were entitled to more land. With the passage of time, this generated social problems that increased until they degenerated into problems of violence and cattle rustling (cattle theft). From the second half of the 18th century, the laws or ordinances of the plains gave the Venezuelan Creole aristocracy the power (this is where the establishment of order began) to &quot;arrest, prosecute and condemn mestizos or pardos&quot; who committed any crime, giving priority to cattle rustling as one of the main crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This establishment of &quot;order&quot; also determined the way in which cattle were branded and the way in which the concept of cattle ownership was managed, as well as the documentation required for the purchase and sale of cattle, horses and other animals that were bred and traded. With the growth of herds and the increase of large landowners, unbranded cattle were especially appropriated by the peones or workers of the plains. This fact, in a way, was protected by the concept of ownership, which said that if the cattle had no brand then it had no owner, and not grazing on land of defined ownership (because there were not yet fences for the savannahs), then it was recognized as a maroon cattle. This problem worsened significantly and was one of the main causes of the drastic application of the mentioned &quot;Ordinances or Laws of the plains&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From the care and possession of livestock, the territory was also conceived from the process of conquest and colonization, determining a landscape that was slowly transformed into prairies suitable for livestock, as well as the development of techniques for the use and manufacture of objects, adaptation of spaces and a whole cultural world determined especially by and for livestock. In some parts of the Orinoquia, the implementation of the laws of the plains took place late, however, these were executed as something common at the time of settling differences between ranchers and owners of estates or herds and it is evident from the oral tradition of the cowboys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is noteworthy that these laws regulated almost exclusively the livestock, horses, pigs, distribution of land and estates in the plains. This shows that from the beginning the establishment of order and control was governed from the livestock production and livestock, in addition to the mere food. Early on, before the 19th century, many of the laws of the plains were being applied. It is worth mentioning that in some parts of Venezuela these laws were officially enacted in the mid-twentieth century, but within the oral culture of the cowboys it is recognized, through their stories, that Simon Bolivar came to sign the laws of the plains a few years before his death in 1830. These laws were also born out of the lack of state presence in these remote places, and for many fathers and grandfathers of the cowboys who participated in this research work, it was a source of pride and honor&nbsp;to comply with them and enforce them. This form of social and territorial order allows us to begin to understand the context in which the culture of the cowboys or plains workers is structured and formed, at first. Determining certain practices related to the trade of cowherding, the ways of relating to each other and other social aspects that have to do with the ways of applying justice and / or punishments for those who broke the rules. This context of isolation from the technologies of the State led these societies to generate this type of agreements to avoid and solve conflicts. These agreements were materialized, among others, in: the marks in the ears, the irons in the skin of the cattle, characteristics of the way in which the extensive cattle ranching is developed, and in general in all this productive sociocultural model that gives origin to the songs of plain work and to all its associated culture.</p>",

The &quot;Culatero&quot; has the job of not letting any of the cattle leave the herd. The Orejeros: their job is to keep an eye on the sides of the herd; they will not allow the cattle to leave the group, but they are in charge of the order on both sides of the herd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For its part the Caballicero as its name suggests, is the one who is responsible solely and exclusively care for the horses used in this demanding work, he will be responsible for driving the horses from the corral to the paddocks to graze, checks that they have no mataduras (name that refers to the peeling on the back of the beasts, caused by sweat and implements) and is aware of bathing them in addition to reviewing the hooves of each of the horses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally there is the Chocotero who was in charge of the details such as food, lodging for the riders, etc., in the long journeys that were made when cattle were taken from Arauca to Villavicencio or Cumaral. This figure of the chocotero, many llaneros today do not know it; that is why, for MinCultura, this fundamental aspect for the work of the llano should be enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&quot;The Chocotero went ahead of the other riders on mules with all the suitcases, he was the one who carried the pots for cooking, for beating the oats... he arrived at the inns in front to ask for permission for the cattle gatherings, for the gatherings of the people in the cattle inns (...) he was in charge of making the food, carrying the suitcases, the pots and pans, the one who made the food and was ahead of the cowboys more or less an hour ahead of the cattle ranch&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, the job of the cabrestero was to guide and lead all the work on the plain, in fact, he is called cabrestero because he will always be the halter in the herd. According to the RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) it is said that cabestro means: &quot;Tame ox that serves as a guide to the bulls, mainly in a bull run&quot;. However, in this case the name is assigned to a person whose experience will be in charge of guiding the livestock along the paths. It should be noted that the name of &quot;cabrestero&quot; is not assigned by mere whim choosing the person at random, this rider must meet at least two requirements, the first is as we said before, to know very well the way, the terrain to travel, and secondly, to know how to sing to guide the herd, in a word, to be an excellent &quot;baquiano&quot;.</p>",

Two cowboys pair up: one ropes, while the other person grabs the animal&#39;s tail and pulls it down. The one who roped then brings the red-hot iron and marks the calf. This work is called the hierra and takes place every six months, in November and May. Later on, the coleo was extended to the savannah, when the horse is hung from the horse to stop the wild cattle from fleeing from the herd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Later, coleo was taken to the streets of the towns during the patron saint festivities. The bocacalles were fenced with guadua and simple boxes were built, ten or more wild bulls were released and each coleador would try to knock his bull down in front of the box of the woman of his affection. The girls would put colored ribbons on the arms of the coleador who brought them a bull. Finally, they built corrals or arenas three hundred meters long by twelve meters wide and three meters high, with corrals or &quot;cosos&quot; in each corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The chute is divided into four zones. The preparation zone is counted from the exit of the bullring and is fifty meters long. Whoever knocks down the bull in this zone has the highest score that is given for the award. The following zones of one hundred meters each are destined for coloring and the score for the bullfight decreases as the bull is knocked down in the first one hundred meters or more. The last zone is not for bullfighting and whoever knocks down the bull there is penalized. It is called the dead zone and is fifty meters long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">More recently the &#39;team penning&#39; (apart and confinement of cattle), is a sport that has generated great national recognition in the world of equine training for the cowherd, plain work and other modalities such as coleo. In these sports, American Quarter Horses, American Pinto and in a lesser preference the Appaloosa horse are used. Equine that, for its muscular strength, the compactness of his body, his explosion and speed and intelligence to understand and manipulate livestock, become perfect specimens to develop such sports originating in the culture of plain work and livestock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The sport consists of a team of three riders who must separate three cattle specifically marked with the same number from a batch of cattle of thirty specimens, and take them to a corral without going over an imaginary limit cattle with a different number than the one assigned. To be clear, there are ten groups of three different herds with the same number. But to better understand and visualize this sport and its rules is worth watching this video&nbsp;that demonstrates the great interest that is generating the sport at the National level and especially in Antioquia and the Eastern Plains.</p>",

This factor of orality will account for the immaterial wealth that throughout history the grandparents have bequeathed to the men born in these lands. In this way, an experience is formalized in a radical way through the experiences of a true llanero.

Due to the particularity of this tradition of the plain work songs, the development of this peasant work has become an expression in danger of extinction like many species of animals, because with the passage of time, it has been drastically confronted with the progress of industry, machines, technology, etc., resulting in the weakening of this tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, for some llaneros this has not been an impediment in their being and daily work, because their work, be it that of a milker, a cabrester, even that of a calf (children who begin with this traditional milking trade) have symbolized their reason for being, rooted in the customs and traditions of their ancestors.</p>",

The plains of the region then baptized with the name of San Mart&iacute;n (which today includes the territory between the Meta and Guaviare rivers) and of Casanare, became giant cattle ranches that completely transformed the landscape and culture of the region. One of the biggest changes that occurred in the plains landscape, due to the promotion of the colonization of the region, was the opening of very extensive trails through which muleteers began to travel who risked their lives transporting, through treacherous and slippery roads. The cattle trails thus became the first commercial route that linked the prosperous and urban area of ​​the altiplano with eastern Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">During the sixteenth century and well into the eighteenth, livestock farming that was practiced in the plains was extensive, which means that it was based on the use by cattle of vast areas of the plains that were used as a common good and in where the animals were controlled and led through jobs such as winching and rodeo to be traded and harnessed once a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the plains of yesteryear there were no fences or limits between the herds or foundations and the only divisions that counted were natural ones such as rivers or streams.

At the same time, many animals had returned to their wild state, thus appearing the bighorn cattle that occupied the savannah and that whoever domesticated and later marked could consider their property. This was, in elementary terms, one of the &quot;Laws of the Plain&quot;, according to which the land belonged to everyone and the free cattle could be taken by whoever had the ability to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">While livestock was consolidating as the predominant commercial activity, an enormous cultural change occurred between the early colonization of the 16th century and the rise of livestock at the end of the 17th century, represented by the processes and conflicts that resulted in the strong integration of the cultures of various indigenous groups with the cultural expressions of the new settlers from the interior of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Music, and especially song, turned out to be the common denominator of all the groups involved in the colonization of the Eastern Plains. When, for example, the Society of Jesus arrived in the region in the seventeenth century with intentions of acculturation and evangelization, its main tool to gain the confidence of the inhabitants of the region was the establishment of music schools in which even to make the instruments themselves - taking advantage of the artisan inclination of almost all the llaneros - and then go on to play and sing Christian hymns with their accompaniment.</p>",

In some of the work songs that can still be heard, it is possible to detect melodies similar to the songs of indigenous groups such as the Sikuani, which were sung in the plains since time immemorial. With the arrival of the first Europeans came the Andalusian melismas that had distant origins in refined Arab songs and also the first instruments such as vihuelas, small guitars that would end up becoming enormously popular throughout the region and that even used to accompany the muleteers on their journeys. as recently as the middle of the 19th century. But perhaps the most important instrument was one that the Jesuits introduced and without which llanera music is inconceivable: the harp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Jesuits managed to spread music to such a degree among the indigenous and Creole population that after their expulsion in 1767 the music never stopped and the manufacture of instruments became an important artisan work in the region. Absent the priests, the melodies of their hymns were slowly transforming - even in the absence of instruments, since many songs, including work songs, are sung a cappella that told proverbs, sayings and stories about the life of the plains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The plains have changed a lot and today they continue to change day by day, but the beautiful sound typical of the region -manifested not only in the music but also in the natural sounds, the japeos and whistles, the a cappella songs and the sounds of work- it has remained a strong constant. The work songs emerged as the most essential and unadorned manifestation of that mestizo atmosphere in which music has always been a precondition for being able to be part of social life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The work songs, which were not accompanied by instrumental music, were strongly attached to the sounds and vocabulary of the llaneros chores, they were positioned as the most primordial of musical expressions, the product of a vital impulse linked to work, to life in the immensity of the savannas and the oral tradition of a group of dissimilar cultures that finally, despite their differences, found a meeting point in an immense shared territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, this harmony is seriously threatened and with it the work songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The reason why cattle are no longer sung in the plains is clear from the total change that has occurred in the plains world that gave rise to them, since that world that overflowed with music of nature, which inspired countless poetic images about the immensity of the natural world and in which a particular vocabulary dedicated to livestock was used, sadly no longer exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Those who previously traveled the plains and sang to their cattle are already very old and having been stripped of their old way of life, they have also been stripped of all authority against the new economic, cultural and social order that has been superimposed on force. on which used to belong to them as llaneros.</p>",

However, it should be noted that, at Easter, mainly on Thursdays and Fridays, these tasks are suspended, since the grandparents of those times, who professed the Catholic faith, gave them to understand that, if these days milking is done, all the milk will turn into blood. On the other hand, this work is carried out by all the members of the family without any distinction of age or sex. The reason is clear, the women participate in the preparation of the cheese together with the girls of the house; While the men take care of the animals, the boy is dedicated to sending the calves to the milker (the father) and the latter in turn brings him closer to the cow so that she can release the milk, in addition to milking the animals, he had to sing softly to him the &quot;put on ... put on my cow.&quot; Another aspect that should be highlighted in this work at dawn is the &quot;hidden&quot; verses. These consisted of an exchange of words that took place between the calf and the milker, which consisted of the calf guessing the particular features of the cow, from the sung couplet that the milker improvised.

And it is precisely in this place, where the man born in these lands sings to the cattle to be able to guide them to other herds or farms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although, this song is a connection of man with animals, and not an interpretation given after reading a music book or some manual for its respective realization. It should be understood that this way of singing arises through an improvised verse, which is not accompanied by any instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also, this song is known as &quot;herding or cattle&quot;, this expression of the culture of the plain, appears in the context of plain work, which consists of being attentive to all activity with livestock. Furthermore, he is in charge of collecting and setting aside, to sell or to work in the corral where the cattle lots are located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&uml;The flat work is carried out twice a year, at the beginning and end of winter, in the months of April - May and November - December, and it is always necessary to have an organized group of workers. The plain works are under the direction of a foreman, saquero or commission agent, who designates the positions depending on whether it is work in the sheet or cattle drive; a caprestero, ear flaps, culateros, chocotero, caballicero, etc.&uml;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Going into details about each of these functions that the flatwork has, it can be implied in the first place, that the Culatero is the rider in charge of lowering the cattle, a different task from that of the winch, since it is pointing (guiding) the cattle to their destination. &quot;The butt&quot; has the task of not letting any animal remain from the herd. Other riders are the ear-eaters: their job consists of being aware of the sides of the livestock; they will not allow the cattle to disperse from the group, but they are in charge of the order to side and side of the cattle lot. For his part, the Caballicero, as his name indicates, is the one who is solely and exclusively responsible for taking care of the horses used in this demanding job, he will be in charge of leading the horses from the corral to the paddocks to graze, he checks them that they are not have slaughter (name that refers to the peeling on the back of the beasts, caused by sweat and implement) and is aware of bathing them in addition to checking the hooves of each of the horses. And finally, there is the Chocotero who was in charge of the details such as food, accommodation for the riders, etc., in the long journeys that were made when livestock were kept.</p>",

This song is particular, due to the fact that it is sung throughout the night and part of the morning, in addition to being very important in the tasks of the plain work. This song was sung when the herd of cattle reached a specific point, which was already prepared by &quot;el Chocotero.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this way, the cattle were led to the corrals during the night, but there was a risk that they would fall asleep, and there the problem began. Any noise put these animals on alert, this event alarmed the cattle and they ran the risk of shuffling, that is, stampeding out, finished in their wake, with all the corrals that the herd had. Precisely, the caporal was in charge of delegating laborers or watchmen to take care of the cattle, and it was through the singing of the candle that the animals calmed down, preventing them from falling asleep, and then with some unexpected noise inside the corral they would wake up and leave terrified to the savannah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It should be clarified that there was not always a corral of passage, generally the horsemen surrounded the cattle lot, watching over them throughout the night between the humor of the horse and the sound of songs. Finally, the objective of this song was precisely to keep the cattle awake, awake, in that all the llaneros who carried out this type of work agree and in this way avoid a shuffle, a violent departure of the cattle at midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Between themselves they took turns working between the cousin and the early morning, that is to say, that at midnight they handed over the shift so that the second would take charge until the early morning of the day. As long as the cattle were kept awake, there was no possibility of wasting time in the early morning to fetch them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The following verses correspond to an example of candle singing, with them it will be possible to better understand the context and intention of these songs, since they contain a reality and a narrative of their own for these hours of the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">To the night watchman who does not sing he wins or shuffles<br />\r\nAnd he&#39;s going to come out with the tale that the devil was to blame.<br />\r\nDon&#39;t fuck around, wake up let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Japa vaca, japa bull, japa the bull paints&#39; o<br />\r\nThat we are dawning, let&#39;s go to town &#39;or<br />\r\nAaaaaaa, aaaaaa, aaaaaa<br />\r\nOuu!

The term is born from the union of two Greek words: gastros (stomach) and nomos (knowledge). In a strict sense, its object is culinary art, the relationship between preparing, serving and consuming food. While Jean Anthelme says: &ldquo;Gastronomy is a knowledge, an understanding, especially what has to do with food. Its objective is to ensure the survival of humanity thanks to a tasty and adequate diet &rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gastronomic culture.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Ministry of Culture of Colombia, &Aacute;ngela Caro recognizes that gastronomic culture is the ingenuity, knowledge and flavor of cooks who make the past dialogue with the present, recreating preparations whose origin is lost in time and merging them with new knowledge, because traditional cuisine as a cultural manifestation is dynamic and evolves day by day. Likewise, In the work of Leyva and G&oacute;mez (as he quotes Sonia Montecino (2009) &quot;cuisine and culture may well be synonymous. Understood as language, the web of human nutrition throws us into a dense matter in which the body, the Techniques and symbols intertwine to produce a warp in different societies. This author proposes us to see society through a fundamental activity, such as food, and how it creates a set of unique characteristics linked to the way to organize and prepare food&quot;.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a region, with the exception of the culinary customs of the indigenous people, the gastronomy usually has different flavors in the same dish. The sweet and sour, bittersweet, spicy and acid flavors predominate by the combination of fruits with meats, pisillos (combination of beef, pork, chicken, chig&uuml;iro and mamona), herbs, seeds, sauces, broths and various kinds of chili. The contrasts in the food that balance the flavors and effects are very prominent, both in the indigenous peoples and in the rest of the inhabitants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An example of the above is the case of coca, conceived as a vehicle of heat that, combined with something cold and pacifying like tobacco, manages to maintain balance to acquire &quot;the power of the word.&quot; The foregoing also applies to the case of seeds, fruits, legumes and meats that, mixed with seasonings such as chili pepper and salt, acquire not only a different flavor, but also new meanings in the culinary world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The indigenous peoples of the Orinoco and the Colombian Amazon classify food according to appearance, taste and texture; This is the case of hard and soft foods: the former associated with the masculine, such as cassava, due to their hardness and rigidity, and the latter, feminine, such as fari&ntilde;a, casabe or manioc, the result of the preparation of cassava to be consumed. In this last aspect, the fact of passing through female hands for consumption is striking. The sweet and the strong do not exactly refer to the flavors, but it has a more symbolic connotation because it relates the sweet with something calm and good. In the same way, strong is related to bravery and pain. For the natives, the cultivated plants are sweet (sajari) and are identified as female labor and the animals that come from hunting and fishing are strong (junirise), seen as male labor. That feminine side in the regions of the Amazon and the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a is the largest producer of food, since it is women who are the &quot;mothers of food&quot; who maintain the cultivation of products such as yucca, pineapple, yam, chontaduro, caimarona grape, among others. . It is the space of relationship with spiritual beings and also with other groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In some places in this region, the cuisine continues to represent culture and tradition, being very peasant and ancestral; However, a good part of this has been affected by globalization, a situation that is reflected in the presence of chemicals in food, hormones, artificial flavors, synthetic or industrialized wines. Eating habits are believed to be one of the most resistant cultural aspects to changing the acculturation process, because that knowledge becomes a form of cultural identity, which shows that the act of eating is not exclusively a biological and nutritional phenomenon, it is also a social expression of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An example of this is the comparison between the culinary traditions of the city man with those of the peasant. The vigor and resistance of the men of rural life, to face the attacks of the environment is greater, compared with that of the city man who consumes junk food, precooked and canned, among others. In a generalized way, the inhabitants of the southeast of the country consume vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and meats, components of a balanced diet, in addition to having a good physical activity due to their hunting, planting, fishing and livestock activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Orinoqu&iacute;a, soups, boiled and sancochos accompanied by a main dish such as fish meat and pisillos, as well as delicate desserts, sponges and jellies, make up a plains menu par excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a llanero is, it is the gastronomy of the region; bittersweet, spicy, intoxicating, strong and well &quot;trancao&quot; for the &quot;parrando&quot;. It&#39;s like a shot of Majule (a highly intoxicating fermented drink) or like a red-hot stove. The Venezuelan writer R&oacute;mulo Gallegos already expressed it in his novel Do&ntilde;a B&aacute;rbara: The plain goes crazy and the madness of the man of the wide and free land is always to be a ranger ... At work: taming and browsing, which are not jobs, but recklessness ; at rest: the plain in the malice of the &quot;chunk&quot;, in the beauty of the &quot;passage&quot;, in the sensual melancholy of the copla; in lazy abandonment: the immense land ahead and not walking, the horizon all open and looking for nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The unique llanera culture, halfway between the horse and the canoe, eats to live, but also lives to eat. Their activities are dominated by livestock, hunting and fishing influenced, most of the time, by the Amazon region from which they inherit a large amount of wild fruits, seeds and jungle plants.</p>",

Fish broths or stews are essential when it comes to tasting a &ldquo;locked&rdquo; breakfast; However, in the region there is a very particular culinary tradition and they are the common &quot;pisillos&quot;. The &quot;pisillado&quot;, as it is known in the region, is nothing more than a mince of beef mainly, cut into thin strips, much desired by its inhabitants. There are fish as the main breakfast companion, along with a good portion of hogao and achiote oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With regard to the broths, the best &quot;raises the dead&quot; after a good &quot;parrando&quot; are the cachama head broths, which provide energy and hydrate the body. The cachama is the most widely consumed Amazonian fish in the plains region. The pioneers and kings of its preparation are in the galleras; When there are festivities or challenges, there is cachama soup for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But the cachama is not the only king fish of the broths, you can also taste another &quot;raise the dead&quot; with the gamitana or tambaqu&iacute;, which competes with the cachama in size and quality; the latter wins for its reputation of being the most delicious in the region.</p>",

Cassava, banana and fruits in juice or pulp such as carambola, pineapple, chontaduro, copoazu, arara and apple-fruit, mainly, cannot be missing in a llanero barbecue.

Its origin comes from the indigenous Chiricoas, who consumed it as soup. It became an alcoholic beverage when it was fermented for several days, for which it was stigmatized for a long time because it is said that whoever drinks it goes out of control, causing the instability of the tribe and reaching extreme cases of murdering their own brothers. In moderation, like everything, it&#39;s actually a tasty, brotherly drink.

It is washed with a lot of water and left to rest for three days in clean water. The cassava skin is then scraped with a knife or machete until it is completely clean and washed. All the yuca is scratched until there is a dough of it and previously scratched yuca is added, that dough is left to rest for two days. Then it goes on to the squeezing process; This is done with the Sebuc&aacute;n (indigenous tool to squeeze), here it is squeezed out of all liquid and the yur&eacute; (poison). The resulting dry mass is extracted from the sebuc&aacute;n and with a mass or machuca stone until it is converted into flour. It is taken to the budare where it will be left for about an hour, during that period of time it must be stirring the flour at all times, after an hour of withdrawing from the budare and that granulated flour is ready to consume alone or as a companion.</p>",

This tradition, perhaps, is one of the most outstanding and unique, not only in the cuisine of the Orinoqu&iacute;a and the Amazon, but also in the world. It is a slow cooking process in which food is cooked in its own juices. The difference with other stoves is that it is cooked on the ground, after opening a hole of approximately 20cm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This technique uses the indirect heat of the fire to obtain a slow cooking process. In this way, the tatuco made up of fish or meat, cassava, banana, seasoned vegetables and the ingredients that the cook prefers is introduced, wrapped in bijao or banana leaves, tied with rope or rope. Then, the same earth that was removed is used to cover the hole and a bonfire is lit on top that will burn for approximately two hours. Once the tatuco is unearthed, it must be cleaned very well and served on fresh banana leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the end you get an exquisite meal. The previous one is one of the most impressive preparations, due to the journey and experience that is needed to open a hole in the ground, introduce a guadua log stuffed with chicken, fish or meat, cover it with banana leaves, light a bonfire and then dig it up for tasting.</p>",

It is one of the most important and fast-flowing rivers of Casanare, with an average of 151 m 3/s. Due to the relief of high slopes of the riverbed and the deforestation suffered by the constant floods in winter, it has a torrential regime that gives rise to alluvial fans between the foothills and the savannah, as in the case of Yopal.</p>",

And, so far, through them, almost a thousand Colombians have been able to preserve part of the country&#39;s biodiversity in 192,698 hectares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">These spaces play a key role in conservation at local and regional scales, in regions where ecosystems are not sufficiently represented or are more degraded and fragmented, and are a fundamental part of the National System of Protected Areas.</p>",

This is due to its decisive role as a production and water recharge area for the Cusiana, Unete Chiquito and Seco rivers. A large number of tributaries originate there, such as the Aguablanca, Cacaguala, Ca&ntilde;o Rico, Par&aacute;sitos and Manoqu&iacute;a streams. In addition, the Los Algarrobos and El Recodo streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another reason for the importance of the Farallones de San Miguel is that it is home to a large endemic fauna with an endangered species warning. Some of these species are the white-tailed deer, the chig&uuml;iro, the macaw, the armadillo or cachicamo. In addition to the charapa turtle, the llanero caiman, the water mouse, as well as different species of bats. Among the reptiles, the populations of crocodiles, babillas, babas, turtles, iguanas and lizards stand out. You can also see lizards, boas and a large number of venomous snakes.</p>",

In this category we group different types of savannahs such as open flooded savannah with sparse and low herbaceous and dense grassy strata, flooded during most of the year with 30-100 cm. of water and presence of palm groves; open seasonally flooded savannah with total absence of woody elements. In addition to the Savannah of banks, lowlands and estuaries defined according to the type of flooding as follows: a) the bank or high place not floodable in the rainy season; b) the low or lowland, part of the savannah that is flooded in the rainy season and c) the estuary that is deeply flooded in the rainy months.</p>",

They can reach a large size and for this reason they are known and representative in the eastern plains. They are found in the wooded savannahs, swamps and near water sources for their displacement since they are good swimmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The main characteristic of the anaconda is its large size, as it can weigh up to 250 kg and measure approximately 9 meters. Its body is olive in color with oval-shaped black spots on the back and black spots with ochre on the sides of its body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The coloration of the dorsal side of the guio is grey with brown or lighter spots on the inside. They can reach up to 5.5 m in length depending on food availability or the sex of the animal.</p>",

This debate is perhaps the most interesting at a time when the boundaries between public and private are blurred, especially as a result of the incursion of new technologies in the home and in the structures of the city (television and the Internet; video surveillance cameras and mass media, etc.) The idea of a public art today acquires a new dimension inevitably linked to an ideological factor,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to the German philosopher J&uuml;rgen Habermas, the concept of public space can be defined as a specific social sphere, and ideally as a place of debate where all citizens can develop and exercise their political will. Hence, it becomes relevant to scrutinize the degree of manifest commitment towards this context, both on the part of the artist and the Institution from which the proposals are formulated and / or accepted, and, therefore, observe from what global and local conception of cities and their public spheres, a type of art destined for public places is promoted, managed and finally developed.</p>",

The sculpture in honor of the Virgin of Manare, patron saint of the Casanare&ntilde;os, is located there. The work, 15 m high, and made by the artist V&iacute;ctor Salamanca Medina, has become a local pilgrimage sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At Easter, for example, thousands of faithful arrive in the capital to undertake a journey to the top of the viewpoint. Already at the top, the image of the Virgin and the panoramic view of the city invite you to a moment of calm and evocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Our lady of sorrows of manare, is recognized as &quot;the virgin of the good trip&quot; to whom the llaneros entrusted themselves in their travels through the vast plains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Her concept was introduced into the Llanera culture by a Spanish Jesuit known as Father Jos&eacute; Guimilla who took it in 1712 to the Beyot&eacute; region, a Colombian indigenous ethnic group that settled on the banks of the Cravo River in the Tame-Arauca region, when it disappeared. Beyot&eacute;, remained in the Manare region to whom it owes its current name until the disappearance of the town and its new relocation and foundation currently known as Paz de Ariporo - Casanare where it currently resides and is venerated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Its incidence in the llanera culture has led it to be an emblematic symbol and its veneration has spread throughout the plains, that is why its rulers have placed it as a symbol of protection for all the inhabitants of the city of Yopal - Casanare .</p>",

In this strip, new forms of cultivation of selected varieties of rice and corn are also practiced and the gigantic plantations of African palm, rubber and Caribbean pine, slowly invade the savannas and transform the landscape.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Casanare was a region of active pre-Hispanic trade. Upon the arrival of the white man, during the 16th and 17th centuries, this effective trade became a war between the tribes, as the European sought to capture indigenous people for slaves and pay them with artifacts of daily use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The indigenous people found were the Guahibos or Sikuanis, Amoruas, Cuivas, S&aacute;livas, Tunebos and Tsiripu or Mariposos. The Jesuits were the first order of religious who entered the territory of Casanare to evangelize. They founded various haciendas, using the labor of the aborigines and began a tireless struggle to dominate the immense savannah that ran from the foothills of Casanare to the banks of the Orinoco River. This was only achieved in Casanare and part of Meta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Near the Meta river there was a settlement made up of the Surimena, Macuco, Jiramena and Casimena estates; It was located on the right bank of the pipe that bears his name, within the territory that today is Santa Elena de C&uacute;siva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The population of Casanare is made up of two ethnic elements such as the mestizo-white and the indigenous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At present, there are eight ethnic groups in the Ca&ntilde;o Mochuelo reservation. In an area of 94,670 hectares and 3,352 inhabitants, is the community of Orocu&eacute;; another in an area of 49,338 hectares, made up of 8 reservations of the S&aacute;liva ethnic group, with 1,280 inhabitants; and the Chaparral and Barronegro reservation of the U&#39;wa ethnic group, which comprises an area of 14,230 hectares, with a population of 416, for a total of approximately 5,048 inhabitants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Initially, the flow of immigrants was predominantly white, corresponding to the colonist named for his origin and roots. Later, starting in the 1950s, the migratory process originated&nbsp;mainly from the Cundiboyacense highlands and other regions of the country, which has resulted in an ethnic and cultural variety with very special characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sociocultural expressions began since the conquest, when the first sociable attempts were made, resulting in a human biotype with a sui generis organization that would learn to live, manage, produce and evolve with the basic elements of a pastoral economy. It should be said that the first settlement with political criteria had its origin on September 27, 1588, when the encomendero Pedro Daza founded the city of Santiago de la Atalayas, an important administrative center that forged the colonial exploitation model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The aboriginal Achaguas and S&aacute;livas, inhabitants of the territory, had a special sensitivity for the arts, especially for music. Of them, many traits, customs, traditions, beliefs and the ancestor in the mestizo man who recognizes his cultural ancestor are still preserved.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In 1492 a milestone in the history of the native peoples was recorded, known as the discovery of America and which in synthesis brought with it the colonization and expansion of the European empires in the new continent. In the shortest of years, indigenous civilizations and peoples were disappearing due to smallpox, measles, hunting and slavery, until they were reduced to small communities in inaccessible places, which recently began to be recognized and protected, although limited to small reservations and territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With the colonizers also came black labor from Africa, brought as slaves, which over the years and the independence process managed to form peoples that still retain part of their rich ancestral African culture. In 500 years of history, since colonization, the demographic map of the American continent was completely transformed, to the point that indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants became ethnic minority groups. In the case of Colombia, the current demographic configuration reveals a populationally diverse country, characterized by diversity of races, ethnicities, languages, cultures, beliefs and worldviews throughout its territory, and therefore it is considered a multi-ethnic and multicultural country, whose origin dates back to the time of the Spanish conquest and colonization, which led to the mixture of various ethnic races and cultures such as Aboriginal, African and European. This process has not been peaceful and much less beneficial for everyone; phenomena such as war, forced displacement, colonization of ancestral territories, poverty and marginalization of ethnic communities, state centralism, the design of undifferentiated policies and the very existence of predominant cultures, among many other factors, certify that the process It&nbsp;has not been beneficial for all and that from the very time of colonization we are regressing as a multiethnic and multicultural country, that is, instead of strengthening this connotation, progress has been made in the annihilation of ethnic groups, languages, cultures, beliefs and visions of humanity. Nowadays,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For example, the accelerated transformation process of Yopal and the exponential growth of its population indicate that the economic aspect has had an impact on the expansion of the agricultural frontier and the exploration of mining and energy, which has led to migratory processes from the rural area to the urban area and fundamentally an accelerated migratory process from different parts of the national territory, a process that has lasted for little more than three decades. The migration that has given rise to a city of about one hundred and ninety thousand people has come mainly from the Cundiboyacense region given its geographical proximity, but it has also been generated from the Pacific and Atlantic regions. Hence, there is a diverse city in every sense, but it has managed to conserve the invaluable heritage of the Llanera culture. Given the above, Yopal is characterized by being a multiethnic and multicultural city, where there are undoubtedly processes of cultural exchange, which means that there is a mixture of various traditions and the coexistence of various population groups with different histories, rhythms, colors, origins and traditions. In this sense, the NARP population of the Municipality of Yopal is part of that cultural symbiosis, but also in a population group or community that coexists with the conservation of important cultural features, and hence the need to achieve Afro cultural preservation. in our territory, as a factor of development. where there are undoubtedly processes of cultural exchange, which means that there is a mixture of different traditions and the coexistence of different population groups with different histories, rhythms, colors, origins and traditions.

Although entrepreneurship has always been present throughout the history of mankind, as it is inherent to it, in recent decades this concept has become of utmost importance due to the need to overcome the constant and growing economic problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The word entrepreneurship comes from the French entrepreneur (pioneer), and refers to the ability of a person to make an extra effort to achieve a goal or objective, being also used to refer to the person who started a new company or project, a term that was later used to refer to the person who started a new company or project, a term that was later used to refer to the person who started a new company or project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This term was later applied to entrepreneurs who were innovators or who added value to an existing product or process, which today has resulted in the current concept of entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In conclusion, entrepreneurship is that attitude and aptitude of the person that allows him/her to initiate new challenges, new projects; it is what allows him/her to go one step further, to go beyond where he/she has already arrived. It is what makes a person dissatisfied with what he is and what he has achieved, and as a consequence, wants to achieve more and start new paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On the other hand, an entrepreneurship project is the enterprise or project that is initiated in order to build or achieve something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Therefore, to undertake means to act or initiate actions to materialize or materialize something, which in the business field translates into the creation of companies and businesses.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An agricultural entrepreneur is understood as an individual or group that has rights to use and exploit land or other elements to carry out agricultural, forestry or mixed activities, and rural entrepreneurship is understood as the creation of new organizations that generate new markets and products or use new technologies from rural areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Today, the contribution of small and medium-sized enterprises to the economy, productivity, innovation, employment, the development of the social fabric and prosperity in general is indisputable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are studies that show that farmers identify themselves as entrepreneurs or at least consider it possible to become them, however, the strength of the entrepreneurial identity is questioned, for example, a study was conducted in Finland and found that only 40% of farmers had entrepreneurial attitudes and of these, only half had attitudes that reflect a growth orientation and willingness to take risks. In turn, the farmers&#39; problem is not in identifying themselves as entrepreneurs, but arose from the farmers&#39; position in the market and their relationship with customers, especially when the farmer&#39;s clientele depends on only one farmer. Thus, there is a need to strengthen entrepreneurial attitudes and initiatives that will enable entrepreneurship to gain strength and position itself with business strategies. At the same time, certain personal characteristics such as self-criticism, leadership, creativity, perseverance and initiative adopted by farmers are necessary for the venture to be successful and sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In addition to the need for certain personal characteristics, agriculture is facing various changes in demand, consumers are aware of genetic modification in animals, chemicals harmful to health contained in plant products and the growing environmental damage, the effect of food production, As a result, legislation is becoming stricter and agricultural entrepreneurship initiatives are increasingly committed to the welfare of animals, the environment and the good use of resources, so that the entrepreneur has to take into account the characteristics of his environment to make the right decisions and allow the business to remain in business. Entrepreneurial initiatives are responsible for economic development, since they generate changes that can become the tool through which problems are solved by means of product and process innovation, market innovation and innovation in organizational forms. Agricultural entrepreneurs must offer high quality products, manufactured in a socially appropriate manner and respecting social values. This illustrates the need for a transition towards a more sustainable agriculture, which is why entrepreneurship appears as an opportunity to find novel and complementary alternatives to development, primarily focused on rural areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thus, entrepreneurship initiatives arise with the intention of finding novel and complementary alternatives to development, mainly with regard to a greater concentration and exploitation of business opportunities and generation of wealth in rural areas. Thus, based on the concept of rural or agricultural entrepreneurship together with the reference to rural development, it is proposed that entrepreneurship, through its creation and transformation activities, could generate contributions to the creation of rural development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Colombian case, according to the last part of the first chapter of the peace agreement in Colombia, the importance and need to seek and make changes and transformations to the countryside is highlighted, and in this sense, it is considered that agricultural entrepreneurship could be the tool to carry out changes such as the promotion of commercial activities of the production of the peasant economy, family and community economy and trying to reduce intermediation, financing or co-financing for the production of the peasant, family and community economy, the integration of the countryside with the city through the connection of rural production with other production models, the establishment of a regional price information system.</p>",

For professionals who are part of the sector, it is a great opportunity to enter the business world, providing goods and services that have an innovative component, added value and a differentiating factor in order to meet the needs, solve problems and shortages or take advantage of opportunities that national and international markets require. On the other hand, there is a growing demand for entrepreneurs capable of discovering new alternatives and anticipating the transcendental changes that the use of technology is generating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are great challenges for entrepreneurs in the sector, since new business opportunities must be aligned with the objectives of sustainable development, which are framed, in a special way, with issues directly related to agriculture. Generating businesses under the parameters of corporate social responsibility requires that the new generations of entrepreneurs be aware of the great commitment to the high percentage of the population that cannot access professional training systems, which leads to thinking forcefully about the environmental, social and economic impact that business initiatives must generate. Another challenge and a great opportunity lies in the implementation of the variables that accompany the fourth industrial revolution, with possibilities of application in the sector, as has already been observed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Understanding that the activities that revolve around the agroindustrial sector have to be seen and recognized as profitable business units, starting from the basic equation:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Revenues - expenses = profit or loss.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">All professionals, regardless of their specific area of knowledge, should know and have a minimum mastery of the financial concepts and fundamentals that are handled on a daily basis in the different transactions that individuals and companies must face.

In addition to the resources offered through rediscount lines such as Finagro. Unlike other times, today&#39;s educational institutions offer among their curricula the possibility for students to acquire entrepreneurial skills, which empower them to go out into the market and fit in the best way in an increasingly demanding system.&nbsp;</p>",

Australia is the country with the largest area, bordering 23 million hectares, followed by Argentina with 3 million and the United States with 2 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Reasons why consumers prefer organic products.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their taste, color and aroma have a better quality compared to agricultural products that have received pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organic products have many more vitamins, minerals and antioxidants than agricultural products that have been affected with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because no chemicals are used, organic agriculture protects the health of farmers and consumers.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organic products are usually certified so there is no way we can be fooled or &quot;taken for a ride&quot;.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Organic products are environmentally friendly and prevent global warming.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Diversity in organic products.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The scope of organic products is not limited to food. Nowadays, an industry has developed with derivatives of organic agricultural products such as organic cotton fibers. There are brands and clothing stores that use only fabrics made from this type of cotton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another industry that has also developed quite rapidly is the personal care industry (shampoos, soaps, oils, among others).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Benefits of organic products from an entrepreneur&#39;s point of view.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is a growing market, which has higher prices and therefore offers higher profit margins. In the organic market there are fewer intermediaries, there is a greater possibility of more direct contact with the buyers of the products.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Since you generally pay higher prices, you will be able to have a higher profit margin, which in turn will allow you to have greater economic flexibility. However, there are also some additional costs to deal with, but if you manage to cope with the difficulties and all the requirements, an organic business can provide more opportunities for profit than conventional businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">On the other hand, starting to sell organic products online is relatively simple and does not require a large initial investment. All that is needed is a website, a brand name and a source of supplies.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tips for starting your own organic produce business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you are interested in starting your own organic produce business you should consider the following tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>1. Follow the rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You should keep in mind that there are rules that cover all sectors of the organic industry. That is why, before launching your business you should do a thorough research and follow the rules, as these are important for the integrity of the organic industry. There are different certificates for these products, whose information can be obtained from the Organic Trade Association website (www.ota.com). Also, keep in mind that there are certain types of organic production that are not covered by the broader organic regulations, such as the manufacture of textiles, cosmetics, etc., which are regulated by private or industry standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2. Know the ways to market your products</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You can market your organic products in different points of sale, such as supermarkets, specialized stores, fairs, through the Internet or direct deliveries to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3. Know what your advantages are over the competition.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although the demand for a certain product is growing in the market, this does not mean that you will be successful in it, since the competition is also greater. Because of this, you must know what your advantages are over your competitors in order to take advantage of them. Not only must you consider the product and the price, but you must also take into account that your product must be reliable, must maintain a certain quality constantly, must have the certifications that guarantee that quality and must have the appropriate logistics to make deliveries quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4. Attend trade fairs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Whether to present your product or to gain more knowledge about the market or to connect with other vendors or suppliers, it is important that you attend trade fairs where organic products are sold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">More and more people worldwide are turning to organic products. While initially driven by a fad that only a few people followed, it has now become a way of life for those seeking protection from the toxins, chemicals, GMOs and preservatives that many commercial products contain today.</p>",

In this sense we can say that the human being is a social being by nature and relies on the help of his peers to be able to endure. The human being is in search of discovering new things to change his life, because he is always looking for innovation to be able to offer welfare to people and thus improve their living conditions, which has been made possible by setting objectives, goals and achievements that are resolved with the various capabilities and efforts that human beings have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nBeing an entrepreneur is the attempt to improve life, that is to say, it does not only correspond to a particular interest, but to a higher one, which is to improve life in society. For what benefits some, can benefit others. Being an entrepreneur also implies adapting to the times in which one lives and at the same time being able to innovate what is established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn the following lessons you will learn about the impacts of entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship as well as success stories from the region.&nbsp;</p>",

Worldwide, all countries that are committed to progress include entrepreneurship as a factor of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nEntrepreneurship is the ability to identify and coordinate productive resources at the service of an innovative idea in order to materialize a business. The entrepreneurial movement fosters competition, variety, selection, cooperation, transformation, evolution, scientific and knowledge advancement, among other positive factors for a country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThere are certain conditions to generate a favorable environment in which entrepreneurs are stimulated and multiply in a society: economic freedom, guarantee of the right to property, policies and regulations related to the subject, education and training infrastructure, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nWhile it is true that entrepreneurship is not the only solution for economic development, it is the key to rescue, channel and accelerate the pace of growth and economic development of a country. This whole process generates a cycle that translates into:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nENTREPRENEURSHIP = ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT = MORE ENTREPRENEURSHIP</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Social impact.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nEntrepreneurship goes hand in hand with education and innovation. The entrepreneurial spirit has become an unequaled force for progress that seeks to be promoted for a better present and a sustainable future. Through the methodological development of projects, an entrepreneur will ensure the fulfillment of his objectives and, hand in hand with them, the strengthening of the society that drives and participates in his dream.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nWhen entrepreneurial projects are created, the initial impact is evidenced in the levels of social prosperity. For Luis Fernando Castro, former executive president of the Chamber of Commerce of Barranquilla, if a business meets the requirements of EAI (high impact entrepreneurship), it increases social mobility (set of movements or displacements made by individuals, families or social groups within a given socioeconomic system), there are better paid wages and higher levels of formal employment. It is therefore essential to develop entrepreneurship platforms that drive innovative projects to higher levels.&nbsp;</p>",

In this way, the peace process is beneficial for the country, because it can lead, in addition to the cessation of the conflict and political reforms, to the opening of new sources of work and employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn this context, entrepreneurship plays an important role in the social and economic, national and local spheres, both for the civilian population and for the people involved in the reintegration process, as well as for the victims of the armed conflict in Colombia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nRegarding entrepreneurship, framed in an entrepreneurial ecosystem to refer to a correlation of social forces where, although the entrepreneur may be the protagonist, he/she is also part of a productive, supportive and inclusive system, constituted by a set of practices and concepts that contribute to the achievement of a certain objective. Entrepreneurship can collaborate, to a great extent, in the effective reintegration into society of people who have surrendered their weapons, that is, to achieve the incorporation into society of people who have been placed outside the law, so that they are covered by legality and, likewise, enjoy the constitutional guarantees and rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nWithin the strategies of entrepreneurship related to the conflict and post-conflict period, public policies stand out, such as the Comprehensive Agrarian Development Policy, aimed at promoting the union of the regions and the socio-economic and equitable development of the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAnother is the Income Generation Program, as a component of the National Government&#39;s Public Policy for Attention to Displacement; it establishes psychosocial support for production, business advice for the formulation and development of the business plan and the delivery of non-reimbursable resources for financing (in accordance with the signing of commitments and social control).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nRegarding the strategy of support from different entities to entrepreneurship, it is possible to optimize results through the formulation of entrepreneurship projects by women victims of the armed conflict, advocating for their reparation, with an active role in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAnother way to create opportunities from business organizations for demobilized and conflict-affected people is through better education and training. The private sector can contribute by having good practices and corporate social responsibility strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe lack of training brings economic disadvantages, such as low productivity, lower quality, poor customer service, waste of raw materials and underutilization of machines; as well as social behaviors such as absenteeism, unpunctuality, abandonment of the workplace, accidents, disability leave and even deaths.</p>",

For ex-combatants, the Colombian State offers technical support; companies that have agreements with the Colombian Agency for Reincorporation (ACR) provide training and advice to entrepreneurs; thus, the Aportando Tiempo program was created, in which companies delegate professionals in administration and management to be trained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nEntrepreneurial education has a transforming effect on people&#39;s behavior in a context of conflict and, therefore, alters their economic circumstances in a way that reduces the tendency to support conflict, with changes in attitudes and thinking about self-employment, with awareness of the multidisciplinary nature of entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nOn the other hand, the constitution of cooperatives has also become a strategy to promote entrepreneurship in conflict and post-conflict contexts, since resources are available for ex-combatants to generate cooperatives and small micro-enterprises as sources of employment and income; those who are organized in guilds obtain greater benefits. The government dynamic of providing solutions to small groups has encouraged the proliferation of small trade associations, which, in the long term, instead of strengthening the struggle, has weakened them as a collective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe social and solidarity economy can guarantee social peace with justice and equity, accompanied by government programs, policies and strategies to promote and strengthen association initiatives, which can be weak in their bonds of trust and solidarity due to the lack of conciliation of interests and conflicts, the unfair practices of capitalism, the low level of solidarity and associativity and individualism, which also weaken coexistence and collective production. However, as for the State, &quot;it is also its duty to solve problems such as lack of opportunities, poverty and violence, which make associative models one of the few ways to get ahead, especially in rural territories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe conflict has affected different sectors of the population, with whom, in the post-conflict period, entrepreneurship has also been promoted, such as the youth sector. (under Law 1014 of 2006 or Law for the Promotion of the Culture of Entrepreneurship).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nLaw 1780 of 2016 or also known as Pro-Youth Law, was enacted with the objective of generating employment for young people aged between 18 and 28 years, through the design and implementation of employment policies, entrepreneurship and the creation of new young companies, along with the promotion of mechanisms that positively impact on the labor linkage of the young population in Colombia.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is also entrepreneurship in indigenous populations. The great variety of indigenous communities and their cultural richness in Colombia, requires an analysis of the factors that affect the profile to be identified and that seeks the promotion of entrepreneurship and associativity. The idea of entrepreneurship in the indigenous population at the national level could be welcomed at the time of projecting development programs for their sustainability and community progress. This indicates that the profile of the indigenous entrepreneur in the country can be characterized by preserving traditional traits; based on this characteristic, productive activities can be generated in the short, medium and long term. For these processes to achieve the desired impact, entrepreneurship and associativity must be stimulated so that the individual or the community become involved voluntarily and taking into account all the cultural, traditional and social variables of each population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nTherefore, in order to develop programs to promote entrepreneurship, associativity and productivity in indigenous communities, these should focus on their wisdom and tradition, taking into account schools for the transmission of their own knowledge, where the older indigenous people spread their wisdom among young people and children, so that they are not unaware of their history as their main heritage and, on this basis, encourage productive activities. In the new stage that Colombia is beginning, displaced indigenous people will return to their territories of origin and entrepreneurship can contribute to the reconstruction of these scenarios.<br />\r\nSome types of entrepreneurship that can be promoted with people or groups reincorporated after the conflict and in the post-conflict period may be:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nTourism entrepreneurship. At the Colombian level, research was carried out to extract the weaknesses, threats, strengths and opportunities of the Department of Choc&oacute;, and a series of actions were proposed to mitigate the impacts on the territory and identify possible scenarios in which demobilized combatants could be included in the labor market. Once the natural attractions of the intervention area were identified, a sustainable tourism product was created, which involved the design of hiking trails - where the demobilized combatants were chosen as guides, since they know the territory - and the design of tourist routes to the Atrato River, since it connects communities on its banks, which will encourage community tourism in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn addition, the potentials and limitations of social entrepreneurship to achieve inclusive tourism are investigated, although in Colombia, this has limitations. Together, continued social benefits depend on the commercial success of enterprises in a highly volatile sector and, in the case of Colombia&#39;s Pacific coast region, in a state of almost continuous violence; even well-managed businesses that are not completely safe. There are conventional tourism businesses - a tourism company, a hotel, a restaurant, a souvenir production and retail sales - that have integrated a social mission into their business model in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nRural entrepreneurship. In terms of reinsertion and reintegration, the amnestied persons benefited from land delivery programs, support for rural housing, credits and some social care commitments. Thus, they tended to return to the countryside, in productive activities, in places other than those where they were part of the guerrillas, and, equally, they often stood out for their social leadership.</p>",

There is also the problem of program sustainability and management, because several DDR programs have failed when, after the transition from international actors to local authorities, compensations were mismanaged, reduced or stopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn conclusion, entrepreneurship is related not only to the creation of enterprises as it is commonly associated, but also to the growth of individuals and communities, by engaging in an environment of education and culture, as an attitude based on knowledge and entrepreneurial practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nFurthermore, entrepreneurship is an alternative for the solution of real problems faced by the population in the reintegration process, as well as by the victims of the conflict, since it not only benefits a particular person, but also fosters the development of the entire community, improves the quality of life of families and promotes innovation to add value to products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nOn the other hand, the role of education in entrepreneurship processes has become fundamental, as it accompanies the formulation of projects with their objectives, goals, strategies and actions that link this sector with the problems of society and, in particular, with the processes of cessation of the armed conflict and the subsequent period of peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAlthough entrepreneurship constitutes a valid strategy of inclusion and productivity for people in the process of reintegration into society, this requires an educational process for the appropriation of concepts and practices for the creation of businesses and productive projects.<br />\r\nWithin the entrepreneurship for victims and ex-combatants, different types are proposed taking into account the potential of the regions where they are located, for example, tourism, rural, cultural, social and other entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nImmigrants and displaced persons in Colombia and other countries tend to have higher rates of self-employment than natives.

However, in Colombia and other countries in the region there is still a long way to go to achieve equity. A study conducted by MasterCard and Endeavor, between 2010 and 2020, highlights that at least 84% of women surveyed agree to some degree that they face more difficulties than men in the process of entrepreneurship, 40% of them have been victims of some kind of discrimination and 97% of the cases are due to gender issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this lesson you will learn tips for entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship from a gender point of view, the importance of female entrepreneurship and success stories from the region.&nbsp;</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Gender influences the opportunities people have in life from birth. Biological differences are important when boys and girls reach puberty, but social roles are assigned from birth. All societies assign different roles, attributes, and opportunities based on sex: boys and girls are socialized to play the roles expected of women and men in their society, based on each society&#39;s ideas about how they should or should not behave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nSex refers to the biological differences between men and women, which are universal and do not change. For example, only women can give birth and only men grow beards. Gender refers to the social differences and relationships between girls and boys, women and men, which have been learned and vary widely within and between cultures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThey also change over time and from one generation to the next. For example, in many countries women care for young children, but increasingly men do so; in some countries women do not work in construction, while in others it is common to see them in this sector. Other variables such as age, social class, ethnicity and disability, and the geographic, economic and political environment influence social differences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nGender roles are reinforced by the values, norms and stereotypes of each society. However, they can and do change. In fact, practices often change faster than people&#39;s ideas about how girls and boys, women and men, should behave. For example, in many societies, girls and women are assumed to be the &quot;weaker sex&quot; and should be protected from heavy workloads. However, poor girls and women often perform heavy work for long hours alongside boys and men.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nGender equality, or equality between men and women, refers to equal rights, responsibilities, opportunities, treatment and valuation of men and women:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp; &nbsp; - In jobs and in companies.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - In domestic work and family care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nTo look at the business life cycle with a &quot;gender lens&quot; is to ensure that men and women have equal opportunities to succeed in life and in business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAll people should be treated with dignity and allowed to develop their full potential to ensure a higher quality of life. It does not mean that men and women must be exactly the same: they can be and indeed are different, but they should have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities and be treated and valued fairly. This applies to the business world as well. Gender equality includes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Equal human and labor rights.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; - Equal value and fair distribution of: responsibilities and opportunities, workload, decision-making and income.</p>",

Sometimes there is fear that progress for women means taking something away from men. However, promoting gender equality does not mean giving more power to women by taking it away from men. It is empowerment for all people: it enables both men and women to participate fully in economic and social life, and leads to a win-win situation for both sexes. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Achieving gender equality is not a &quot;women&#39;s issue&quot; but the responsibility of society as a whole.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn the past, most of those who advocated gender equality were women. Therefore, it has sometimes been thought that this issue only concerns women and not men; but this idea is disappearing. There is a growing consensus that gender equality is a matter for men and women, that it is the responsibility of society as a whole, and that it requires the contributions and inputs of both men and women.&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe promotion of gender equality must be integrated into business development programs at all stages of their cycle: during design,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>implementation, monitoring and evaluation.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIt is necessary to conduct a gender analysis and address inequalities between men and women. It will also be necessary to assess and measure that the effects and impacts of development programs benefit and impact both men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\n<strong>Women entrepreneurs and their context.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot everyone is a natural-born entrepreneur. Especially for women, entering into an entrepreneurial project is a consequence of necessity and not of free choice. To discover personal entrepreneurial characteristics is to see oneself in the present, to form ideas about the future and to set a long-term goal for one&#39;s life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nIn many societies and economic situations, people, and especially low-income women, do not have many opportunities to assess their own situation, realize their own strengths and overcome their weaknesses when facing the entrepreneurial world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAround the world, women are generally engaged in very small businesses, and it is difficult for many women entrepreneurs to grow them. Women are often unaware of their unequal representation in the business world. In addition to their entrepreneurial activities, they have many family and domestic responsibilities. They often face pressures to share the benefits of the business at home, with the extended family and with the community.</p>",

The Fund seeks to promote, finance and support entrepreneurship, formalization and business strengthening of women in rural and urban areas and already has a program underway, the first of a portfolio of initiatives to come in the future.</p>",

Some of these are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Working in a chain:</strong> From his experience, Diego Jaramillo, general manager of the Karisma hotel chain for Latin America, states that it is necessary to join forces with airlines, tour operators and hotels to generate a more attractive offer of tourism products in the region.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Strengthen the value offer: </strong>Gustavo Toro Vel&aacute;squez, national executive president of Cotelco, refers to the issue of informality, i.e. the offering of lodging services without complying with legal requirements. &quot;This issue generates unfair competition against traditional hotels because these companies do not have the tax or operational burden of hotels&quot;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To combat this phenomenon, it is key that formal accommodations reinforce their value offer and communicate it effectively through suitable digital platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Considering that many of their managers are empirical, it is necessary that they join the dynamics of the industry that is advancing faster in areas such as technology, innovation, market analysis, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Expand markets and destinations: </strong>Paula Cort&eacute;s Calle, president of the Colombian Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (Anato), explains that improving infrastructure in areas of the country where it was not previously viable to have access is a pending task, as well as the search for more and better agreements that favor international connectivity so that, in this way, the showcase of tourism options offered by Colombia and its travel agencies can grow and thus reach new markets with competitive offers.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Strengthening suppliers:</strong> In the tourism industry, SMEs are not only on the side of hoteliers and agencies, but also of product and service suppliers. Diego Jaramillo, as a representative of an international chain, states that one shortcoming he finds in the country is the lack of suppliers that can meet the demand in regional terms. Meeting this need represents an opportunity for SMEs that could be inserted in this economy of scale and bet on international expansion. The executive emphasizes that Colombian suppliers are structured and sophisticated, qualities that should not be wasted.</li>\r\n</ul>",

The priority of this type of tourism is the enjoyment of the experience rather than the destination. Its admirers shy away from the masses, that is, from crowded places. They enjoy the spontaneous, close and natural, and to establish relationships with the locals and their traditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tourism trends in 2021.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Domestic tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">National or domestic travel is the trend in destinations. National tourism, also called local or domestic tourism, involves the traveler&#39;s mobilization within the borders of his own country and will be increasingly local according to the proximity of the destination to the place of origin. This type of tourism does not require additional documentation, since it is the same country, and does not represent any barrier with respect to language or currency used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Family tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Family tourism, as its name indicates, is that in which the family group is mobilized, totally or partially, that is to say, two or more members of the family can travel. The purpose of this type of tourism is to strengthen family ties through the tourist experience, so its definition is framed within particular limits and requirements. For example, it requires hotel infrastructure capable of accommodating a complete family group, as well as recreational activities that entertain each and every one of its members. Likewise, destinations must have the necessary technology and resources to facilitate the mobilization and stay of a large number of people, since the trip must be a reason for relaxation for the family and not for added stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Business and event tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As globalization and technology advance, business tourism, also known as MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions) tourism, is gaining ground within the tourism sector. By definition, the individual who does business tourism travels for the need to fulfill work and professional matters such as conventions, events, congresses or exhibitions. The changes in business tourism and events due to the pandemic have generated new relationships and forms of organization such as hybrid and online events, although face-to-face events will return.</p>",

In this type of tourism, tourists travel to small communities, usually rural, in order to learn about their lifestyle and culture or, in some cases, to disconnect from the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nature tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">These trips are made in the context of nature, relaxation and enjoyment of the environment, in addition to the practice of activities related to the area. Within this framework, there is a varied offer of activities for 5.0 travelers. Its activity is quite diversified and revolves around contact with nature and its preservation, so it is deeply linked to sustainable tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Similarly, nature tourism has laid the foundations for the development of other types of tourism, among which are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Agro-tourism, where tourists have the opportunity to visit vineyards, farms and other food production and processing plants.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ecotourism, where tourists visit preserved areas such as national parks or reserves. This type of tourism promotes stays with a lower environmental impact and activities aimed at protecting natural areas.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wild tourism, where the main attraction is to be in contact with animals in their natural habitat.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adventure tourism, which by definition includes physical activities such as mountaineering, hiking, climbing, among others.</li>\r\n</ul>",

Within this group, cosmetic surgery is one of the most demanded, although it can be any procedure or consultation. This type of tourism has been one of the most criticized worldwide, mainly because the reasons that move the tourist are very varied and range from economic reasons, in some places it is cheaper than in others, or for reasons of legality. In some cases, the national government itself is in charge of promoting and developing health tourism, as in the case of Turkey where, thanks to various subsidies and agreements, hair implant surgeries are cheaper than in other countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cultural tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In cultural tourism, the tourist wishes to know all the cultural aspects related to a country of interest, which includes, in most cases, its history, art and gastronomy. This type of tourism brings great benefits to the sector as it attracts travelers at all times of the year and promotes the development of the destination&#39;s local identity. Among the main activities sought by travelers are visits to museums, attendance to festivals or tasting of local gastronomy; it also includes more intimate celebrations of the locality or even language learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gastronomic tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Gastronomic tourism is part of cultural tourism, however, in this case, the tourist only seeks to taste the local gastronomy and not to explore other cultural areas. Gastronomic activities include tasting as many dishes and drinks as possible and experiencing all the culinary activities linked to them. Similarly, many destinations have gastronomic routes or culinary festivals scheduled at different times of the year. These events mobilize many tourists and generate an important economic impact in the area. Add also that the gastronomic experience will be as deep as the traveler desires, ranging from visits to restaurants to personal cooking classes given by the local population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Wellness tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Wellness tourism is a direct branch of health tourism that aims to achieve physical, psychological and spiritual well-being. For this reason, tourists choose destinations where activities related to each area are carried out, such as yoga, meditation or spiritual retreats. This type of tourism is becoming more popular as the concept of mindfulness spreads and as society becomes more aware of the importance of preserving health. The latter is what differentiates it from health tourism, which seeks to restore health once it has been lost. Among the preferred destinations for wellness tourism are: India, Spain, Singapore, Malaysia, California, Bali, Italy and Hawaii.</p>",

Therefore, this type of tourism includes exchange trips, summer courses or guided visits to laboratories or institutions. The activity within this sector has become increasingly diversified as international cooperation ties in education are fostered. Tourists, mainly students, are often invited to take part in educational tourism in order to learn about their learning options in a country other than their country of residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Sports tourism.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sport can be experienced in two ways, as a fan or as an athlete, and sports tourism involves both. The main reason that moves this type of tourist is the celebration of sporting events beyond the borders of the country where he/she resides; among the most popular are: soccer world cups, major baseball or basketball leagues and the Olympics. These types of events generally give rise to venues and infrastructure that contribute to local tourism and continue to attract more tourists in the future, as is the case of stadiums such as the Santiago Bernabeu, which in 20 years has attracted more than 15 million visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In short, giving an answer to tourism trends is complex, especially because there are as many types of tourism as there are tourists&#39; tastes; the main difference is that some become so popular that they become a trend. What makes one type of tourism more popular than another? Well, it is a multifactorial matter, in which the continuous renovation of the sector makes it always suitable to receive tourists of all generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Every year new ways and forms of tourism are added to the list. However, the aim is always the same: to satisfy the expectations and desires of the traveler, whatever they may be. In this sense, the sector faces a great challenge: to promote the creation of new tourist destinations, strengthen those that are doing well and renew those that have become obsolete; all in a race against the clock to attract the greatest number of travelers and become a trend for the coming seasons.</p>",

And while it is an excellent option for entrepreneurship, it must be taken into account that these ventures require an adequate number of responsible, competent and, above all, clean personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In addition to the personnel, there are other factors that, if fulfilled, make the business go ahead and achieve the break-even point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Factors to take into account for a gastronomic business.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The business idea.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is an indispensable element when starting a gastronomic business. It is important to start from the concept and define well what you want to achieve. Generally the most basic points to be determined are the type of restaurant and the target public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Market research.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Market research and analysis will surely give a more accurate answer as to where to aim. If the idea is to set up a small business, an opinion survey can be carried out among the target public, but if the venture is larger, a more careful and precise analysis is always recommended, at a professional level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The location.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This point refers to defining the strategic location of the venture. In order to determine the best location, the fixed costs represented by the place and how they affect the general budget must also be taken into account. In addition, other aspects should also be considered when choosing the location, such as traffic frequency, if it is an office area, if there is parking space, if there is too much competition, etc. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Menu development.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The menu is the basis of the gastronomic business because it defines its differential factor before the competition and encompasses the general concept of the business. Regardless of the size of the enterprise, the key to success lies in knowing how to choose the right and adequate menu for the target public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Cost structure.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is another important point to take into account when starting a gastronomic business. In addition to analyzing the investment figure and the cash flow, a balance must be established between the amounts invested and spent to obtain profits.</p>",

The new normality proposes to discourage the use of cash, to the extent that people feel safer making their payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Innovative hamburgers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The hamburger, which was the most ordered dish in 2020 through home delivery, will continue to gain market share due to its practicality, ease and multiplicity of options to offer. &nbsp;As a result, establishments in this category will need to use innovation in their recipes to win consumer preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Support for local enterprises.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The situation we have lived through, besides affecting the lifestyle we used to lead, has also meant a hard blow to the country&#39;s economy and to short-lived entrepreneurs. As a result, people and companies have realized that, by supporting local enterprises and businesses, they are contributing to the growth of the economy and the creation of new jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A culture of cooperativism will continue to be promoted to foster income alternatives and take advantage of technology to create new opportunities.</p>",

                                 "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Plant-based products: The canvas for innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As personal health and global sustainability have proven to be strong drivers of consumer choice, plant-based product innovation and development has shifted from mimicking meat, fish and dairy products to optimizing choices that stand on their own merits. When asked what reasons consumers have for considering plant-based alternatives, they tell us they consider them healthier and better for the planet. A third reason, the desire for dietary variation, is further driving interest in plant-based beyond the traditional vegan and vegetarian sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the last year there has been a 59%* increase in new plant-based products that also carry a premium or indulgence claim. This is another indication that, from convenience food to gastronomy, people are looking for the quality alternatives that plant-based products can offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gut care.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A report revealed that consumers are now looking for foods that are geared toward improving their personal health and well-being. Respondents said that aspects of health such as immunity, energy levels, good sleep and mood are directly related to good gut health. On the other hand, 67% of respondents stated that gut health is key to achieving overall wellness. Therefore, products that include fiber or probiotics will increase in demand as they continue to offer health benefits to consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Back to the roots</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the wake of the pandemic, shoppers increasingly value the functionality, freshness and authenticity of local foods. A growing habit among consumers is to look for companies that guarantee a positive impact on the community, as well as freshness and naturalness. The majority of people who had purchased locally sourced products said they would do so again in the coming year. Among these products, the attributes that most stand out are their freshness, flavor and nutritional benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Broaden experiences.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to Lu Ann Williams, director of Insights and Innovation at Innova Market Insights, the pandemic also accelerated consumers&#39; desire for new challenges and experiences. More than 50% of respondents said that, post-Covid-19, they want to be more adventurous with their food and beverage choices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The report also revealed that consumers want to see more strategic partnerships in order to create new flavors, textures or to innovate in presentation formats. However, a sector of respondents noted that this desire to explore new horizons is only possible with familiar and trusted brands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Recycling redefined.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Creating food from waste is positioning itself as a great circular economy option. Ingredients that were once considered waste now have a new life in the circular economy and consumers identify with this trend. 35% of people responded that products containing recycled ingredients are more appealing than others. Attributes such as sustainability, health and nutrition and freshness are what the public rescues most from this type of products. More than 255 products are seeking to receive the new Upcycled Food Association seal, which will be the first brand in the world to certify foods with recycled ingredients.</p>",
