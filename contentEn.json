These musical expressions were developed during the colonial period with influences from Baroque music and inter-oceanic trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until the middle of the 20th century, and as far as the plains region of Venezuela and the Eastern Plains of Colombia are concerned, the word joropo referred to a social event -almost a fair- lasting from a few hours to a whole week. People from the locality or people coming from different places, generally attracted by the commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>",

However, its main difference is that the playing time is slower and the accents are more perceptible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In El Pasaje we find a freer musical structure, which allows the performer and composer greater creativity and therefore greater versatility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Passage is formally developed in two sections or stanzas.

In the plains the term periquera also means heated discussion, quarrel or fight. It has been pointed out that after the battle of La Periquera the army of Paez celebrated with a joropo and because of this La Periquera is a type of joropo used especially for the accompaniment of the contrapunteo and can be performed between two or more singers improvising couplets on a certain theme or argument that is often used for the contrapunteo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The name of the &quot;golpe&quot; may be due to a jocular correlation established by the llaneros between the song of the wild parakeets and the song of the &quot;golpe&quot;, characterized by a high-pitched voice and a rapid syllabic phrasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Regarding the origin of the name, other opinions point out that this blow, which they say was Bolivar&#39;s favorite and that Paez executed it very well, was an air dedicated to Periquera, a hamlet located on the right bank of the Sarare River from which the current Guasdualito was constituted. It is also said that the village took its name from the hustle and bustle of parrots, macaws and parakeets, which abounded on the banks of the river.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also known as Juana Guerrero and Mocho Hern&aacute;ndez, due to some texts sung about this piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Sound element:</strong></p>",

For Colombia it is known that it was composed by Mr. Pedro Francisco Vivas, a musician from Casanare, between 1900 and 1910. This rhythm is one of the oldest rhythms according to oral tradition, and is better known in its instrumental form than with lyrics. The harmonic structure of this rhythm is divided into two parts A and B, and is played in a por corrido system. Part A uses the degrees (I, I, I, I, I, I, V7, V7, V7, V7, V7), and part B (V7/IV, IV, I, I, V7, I).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sound element:</strong></p>",

Also, this imaginary alludes to the trades that this task demands and to vast extensions of savannahs, flat land or highlands. The imaginary has also been constructed in relation to a territory far from the cities and associated with great difficulties of access, to gigantic extensions of wastelands and to all sorts of mestizo cultural practices where the joropo, dance, song and a strong oral culture are some of the most representative characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The expansion and flourishing of cattle ranching in the Colombian Orinoquia since the 17th century was possible, in large part, thanks to the possibility of bringing large livestock productions to the areas of consumption by means of a network of cattle trails. &quot;During the New Granada, while large herds were established on the Atlantic coast, Tolima and the Magdalena plains, livestock, roads and meat consumption defined the economic vocation of the Eastern Plains&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The work of the cowboys who dedicated their lives to this work and to the development of this trade was also essential. Since then, the roads that were opened or that, being indigenous roads in pre-colonial times, were adapted for the herding of cattle have been fundamental, thus connecting the different estates and herds with nearby populations, as the practice of cattle ranching grew and techniques were developed to adapt, guarantee survival and transform the environment. &quot;In rural societies, the road networks that connect the territory continue to be used frequently despite the development of roads. Roads, despite their progressive abandonment, articulate social relations, practices and meanings&quot;. Colombia owes much of its development, communication, and construction of its nation territory to the trade of muleteering, cowherding, mules, horses, cattle trails, mule trails, and roadside inns.</p>",

                                    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is reference to something similar to &quot;plain work&quot; towards the end of the 16th century; that is, only a century after the Spaniards had arrived in America, this activity was already foreshadowed. It seems that the work of the plains (domestication and management of cattle) has to do with a need that is more related to the demands of the environment and a wild context that demanded the development of techniques to domesticate both maroon cattle and horses and the development of knowledge of nature and various technologies, than to a simple inheritance or learning of a model derived from the Jesuit herds, as many cowboys state in their stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Before there was the concept of ownership of land, there was the concept of ownership of cattle and, based on the ownership of rodeos or the number of head of cattle, the common right of use was granted or claimed, and later (when fences were built), on the possession of the land. This was given in the beginning by customary laws that were consolidated through something socially accepted by the ranchers or owners, which became the&nbsp;maximum expression of the repressive colonial legislation around the year 1811, sanctioned as &quot;the laws or ordinances of the plain&quot; in the state of Gu&aacute;rico and that later would extend throughout the entire Colombian-Venezuelan Orinoquia. The laws or ordinances of the plains were then implemented in different places of this territory since the beginning of the 19th century, but they had already been prepared for more than a century by the Jesuit herdsmen, who carried out a powerful pedagogical work and prepared the minds of the Creoles and mestizos since the end of the 17th century. Through these laws it was established, among other things, that the ownership of land would eventually be granted only to those who had cattle and in an amount corresponding to the size of their herd; in this way, as we see today, the richest were entitled to more land. With the passage of time, this generated social problems that increased until they degenerated into problems of violence and cattle rustling (cattle theft). From the second half of the 18th century, the laws or ordinances of the plains gave the Venezuelan Creole aristocracy the power (this is where the establishment of order began) to &quot;arrest, prosecute and condemn mestizos or pardos&quot; who committed any crime, giving priority to cattle rustling as one of the main crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This establishment of &quot;order&quot; also determined the way in which cattle were branded and the way in which the concept of cattle ownership was managed, as well as the documentation required for the purchase and sale of cattle, horses and other animals that were bred and traded. With the growth of herds and the increase of large landowners, unbranded cattle were especially appropriated by the peones or workers of the plains. This fact, in a way, was protected by the concept of ownership, which said that if the cattle had no brand then it had no owner, and not grazing on land of defined ownership (because there were not yet fences for the savannahs), then it was recognized as a maroon cattle. This problem worsened significantly and was one of the main causes of the drastic application of the mentioned &quot;Ordinances or Laws of the plains&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">From the care and possession of livestock, the territory was also conceived from the process of conquest and colonization, determining a landscape that was slowly transformed into prairies suitable for livestock, as well as the development of techniques for the use and manufacture of objects, adaptation of spaces and a whole cultural world determined especially by and for livestock. In some parts of the Orinoquia, the implementation of the laws of the plains took place late, however, these were executed as something common at the time of settling differences between ranchers and owners of estates or herds and it is evident from the oral tradition of the cowboys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is noteworthy that these laws regulated almost exclusively the livestock, horses, pigs, distribution of land and estates in the plains. This shows that from the beginning the establishment of order and control was governed from the livestock production and livestock, in addition to the mere food. Early on, before the 19th century, many of the laws of the plains were being applied. It is worth mentioning that in some parts of Venezuela these laws were officially enacted in the mid-twentieth century, but within the oral culture of the cowboys it is recognized, through their stories, that Simon Bolivar came to sign the laws of the plains a few years before his death in 1830. These laws were also born out of the lack of state presence in these remote places, and for many fathers and grandfathers of the cowboys who participated in this research work, it was a source of pride and honor&nbsp;to comply with them and enforce them. This form of social and territorial order allows us to begin to understand the context in which the culture of the cowboys or plains workers is structured and formed, at first. Determining certain practices related to the trade of cowherding, the ways of relating to each other and other social aspects that have to do with the ways of applying justice and / or punishments for those who broke the rules. This context of isolation from the technologies of the State led these societies to generate this type of agreements to avoid and solve conflicts. These agreements were materialized, among others, in: the marks in the ears, the irons in the skin of the cattle, characteristics of the way in which the extensive cattle ranching is developed, and in general in all this productive sociocultural model that gives origin to the songs of plain work and to all its associated culture.</p>",

The &quot;Culatero&quot; has the job of not letting any of the cattle leave the herd. The Orejeros: their job is to keep an eye on the sides of the herd; they will not allow the cattle to leave the group, but they are in charge of the order on both sides of the herd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For its part the Caballicero as its name suggests, is the one who is responsible solely and exclusively care for the horses used in this demanding work, he will be responsible for driving the horses from the corral to the paddocks to graze, checks that they have no mataduras (name that refers to the peeling on the back of the beasts, caused by sweat and implements) and is aware of bathing them in addition to reviewing the hooves of each of the horses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Finally there is the Chocotero who was in charge of the details such as food, lodging for the riders, etc., in the long journeys that were made when cattle were taken from Arauca to Villavicencio or Cumaral. This figure of the chocotero, many llaneros today do not know it; that is why, for MinCultura, this fundamental aspect for the work of the llano should be enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&quot;The Chocotero went ahead of the other riders on mules with all the suitcases, he was the one who carried the pots for cooking, for beating the oats... he arrived at the inns in front to ask for permission for the cattle gatherings, for the gatherings of the people in the cattle inns (...) he was in charge of making the food, carrying the suitcases, the pots and pans, the one who made the food and was ahead of the cowboys more or less an hour ahead of the cattle ranch&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, the job of the cabrestero was to guide and lead all the work on the plain, in fact, he is called cabrestero because he will always be the halter in the herd. According to the RAE (Royal Spanish Academy) it is said that cabestro means: &quot;Tame ox that serves as a guide to the bulls, mainly in a bull run&quot;. However, in this case the name is assigned to a person whose experience will be in charge of guiding the livestock along the paths. It should be noted that the name of &quot;cabrestero&quot; is not assigned by mere whim choosing the person at random, this rider must meet at least two requirements, the first is as we said before, to know very well the way, the terrain to travel, and secondly, to know how to sing to guide the herd, in a word, to be an excellent &quot;baquiano&quot;.</p>",

                                    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The coleo is the sport that was born in the task of branding calves in the corral. Two cowboys pair up: one ropes, while the other person grabs the animal&#39;s tail and pulls it down. The one who roped then brings the red-hot iron and marks the calf. This work is called the hierra and takes place every six months, in November and May. Later on, the coleo was extended to the savannah, when the horse is hung from the horse to stop the wild cattle from fleeing from the herd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Later, coleo was taken to the streets of the towns during the patron saint festivities. The bocacalles were fenced with guadua and simple boxes were built, ten or more wild bulls were released and each coleador would try to knock his bull down in front of the box of the woman of his affection. The girls would put colored ribbons on the arms of the coleador who brought them a bull. Finally, they built corrals or arenas three hundred meters long by twelve meters wide and three meters high, with corrals or &quot;cosos&quot; in each corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The chute is divided into four zones. The preparation zone is counted from the exit of the bullring and is fifty meters long. Whoever knocks down the bull in this zone has the highest score that is given for the award. The following zones of one hundred meters each are destined for coloring and the score for the bullfight decreases as the bull is knocked down in the first one hundred meters or more. The last zone is not for bullfighting and whoever knocks down the bull there is penalized. It is called the dead zone and is fifty meters long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">More recently the &#39;team penning&#39; (apart and confinement of cattle), is a sport that has generated great national recognition in the world of equine training for the cowherd, plain work and other modalities such as coleo. In these sports, American Quarter Horses, American Pinto and in a lesser preference the Appaloosa horse are used. Equine that, for its muscular strength, the compactness of his body, his explosion and speed and intelligence to understand and manipulate livestock, become perfect specimens to develop such sports originating in the culture of plain work and livestock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The sport consists of a team of three riders who must separate three cattle specifically marked with the same number from a batch of cattle of thirty specimens, and take them to a corral without going over an imaginary limit cattle with a different number than the one assigned. To be clear, there are ten groups of three different herds with the same number. But to better understand and visualize this sport and its rules is worth watching this video&nbsp;that demonstrates the great interest that is generating the sport at the National level and especially in Antioquia and the Eastern Plains.</p>",

The joropo encloses in the fandango its Afro-American origin with small indigenous contributions. The first fandangos arrived in Caracas at the beginning of the seventeenth century, they were played in the evenings of the great cacaos in the capital&#39;s haciendas and were performed with instruments such as the bandurria, the instrument, the harpsichord and the bandola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Etymology:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The word &quot;joropo&quot; comes from the Arabic &quot;xarop&quot; which means &quot;syrup&quot; and is related to the Mexican syrups from Guadalajara. There are those who say that the joropo is a Caribbean voice; likewise, there are people who maintain that it comes from Quechua.</p>",

People from the locality or people coming from various places, generally attracted by commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)</p>",

Then in Egypt in a wall painting in the tomb of Nakht, Theban necropolis, New Kingdom, 1425-1405 BC. Arched, it first appears without a column. Its small number of strings is variable. Still in use in Africa, the bowed harp has undergone many evolutions and improvements over the centuries, thanks to the many civilizations that have practiced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The origin of the llanera harp dates back to the Jesuit religious who contributed extensively to the implementation of the harp in religious services, who brought the instrument from Spain, but over the years, it began to be manufactured in this place for the convenience of the musicians. In the first instance, the harp was an instrument used in churches and for private concerts in the houses of the rulers. Thanks to the Jesuits themselves, they decided to teach music to their congregants. The harp spread to the plains areas.</p>",

It is a plucked chordophone consisting of four strings. This is variety of the archaic four-stringed vihuela or Latin guitar, but in a larger box. It is traditionally used in joropos, passages and llanero airs instead of the current harp, since the classic organology of the llaneros was composed by bandola, cuatro and capachos. According to Carlos Rojas, the bandola llanera is a melodic guitar with four strings, two of which (the third and fourth) are made of metal and the other two of nylon. With a flat back and pear-shaped, traditional models have a short neck or fingerboard with only seven frets; modern versions, while maintaining the short neck design, present, in the manner of the Spanish guitar, frets embedded on an extension of the fingerboard on the soundboard. It is played with plectrum or pajuela, held between the thumb and index finger, combined in some segments of the piece with very percussive plucking of the first string called jalaos, made with the nail of the middle or ring finger and that are a form of response to the bordoneos (melodic songs implemented in the low register). Other common forms of execution are the segundeo (descending rasgueos) and the trapeo (rasgueos asordinados). The new generations of bandolistas also use melodic ornamentations such as the trill (tr&eacute;molo) sometimes played over the whole group of strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This type of archaic Hispanic lute, whose history in the llanera region is unfortunately very little documented, was rescued from an almost extinct tradition around the middle of the 20th century and has reached in recent years a remarkable virtuosic development that has led it to become the only melodic guitar in live use in the current joropo. It is a consubstantial instrument of the &quot;recio&quot; style joropo (with an accelerated tempo and great rhythmic vivacity), and is used in the interpretation of &quot;golpe&quot; and &quot;pasaje&quot;.</p>",

Its peculiar tuning is not totally ascending, it is small in size and owes its name to the number of strings it has. It should not be confused with the current Puerto Rican cuatro of five orders and ten metallic strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roots:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It has very remote origins. Similar instruments appear in Iranian and Cretan engravings in ovoid and square shape. In the year 3.000&amp; B.C., similar instruments are found in Egypt, derived from Chaldean-Assyrian instruments. The Arab lute or thimphle, through the Moorish invasions, arrived in Spain at the beginning of the 16th century with four orders, where it adopted a new shape, less oval and more similar to the current one, in the shape of an &quot;eight&quot;. Later, Maestro Salinas -Maestro de capilla of the Catholic Monarchs- added the fifth string and Vicente Espinel -who established the current strophic form of the tenth string- added the sixth string at the beginning of the XVII century (known as bordon or espinela) giving origin to the Guitar. The lute arrived in the Canary Islands, until it became the timple. This would be exported to America and the Caribbean with the Conquest of America, giving rise, many years later, to the versions known today in South America. The Puerto Rican cuatro, however, bears more resemblance to its ancestor the lute than to the timple of the Canary Islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also known as the cuatro llanero or traditional cuatro, it is an inseparable part of typical llanera music ensembles, along with the llanera harp (or bandola, as the case may be). It usually has an accompaniment function, although it can also occupy a soloist position, as a concert instrument, in some cases (usually outside the scope of the aforementioned llanera music).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is normally played strumming the strings with the right hand and making the chords with the left hand. The standard tuning does not allow many exits from this scheme, so sometimes it is necessary to change the tuning to reach new melodic possibilities, as in the case of the cuatro soloist.</p>",

In the Llanos they are used as accompaniment to the harp and the cuatro in joropo ensembles. The player is known as maraquero. Despite the simplicity of the instrument, the maracas llaneras have achieved an impressive technique of syncopations and contratiempos at high speed. In some regions the player also sings.</p>",

The events and experiences have been the reason to unite the past and the present of the woman and the plainsman with the daily life, which he updates through the experiences that arise from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This identity experience of the plainsman is not constructed from a purely external perspective, that is, not only from the experiences acquired through physical contact in daily work, but also intrinsically complements it through the founding component supplied to the majority of Colombian cultures: oral tradition. This factor of orality will account for the immaterial wealth that throughout history the grandparents have bequeathed to the men born in these lands. In this way, an experience is formalized in a radical way through the experiences of a true llanero. This oral tradition has been expressed in many ways, whether through legends, myths, mystery stories, or anecdotal events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Llano work songs are vital to characterize the llanero man in his behavior, his way of relating to nature, with others and with the transcendent. Due to the particularity of this tradition of the plain work songs, the development of this peasant work has become an expression in danger of extinction like many species of animals, because with the passage of time, it has been drastically confronted with the progress of industry, machines, technology, etc., resulting in the weakening of this tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, for some llaneros this has not been an impediment in their being and daily work, because their work, be it that of a milker, a cabrester, even that of a calf (children who begin with this traditional milking trade) have symbolized their reason for being, rooted in the customs and traditions of their ancestors.</p>",

The plains of the region then baptized with the name of San Mart&iacute;n (which today includes the territory between the Meta and Guaviare rivers) and of Casanare, became giant cattle ranches that completely transformed the landscape and culture of the region. One of the biggest changes that occurred in the plains landscape, due to the promotion of the colonization of the region, was the opening of very extensive trails through which muleteers began to travel who risked their lives transporting, through treacherous and slippery roads. The cattle trails thus became the first commercial route that linked the prosperous and urban area of ​​the altiplano with eastern Colombia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">During the sixteenth century and well into the eighteenth, livestock farming that was practiced in the plains was extensive, which means that it was based on the use by cattle of vast areas of the plains that were used as a common good and in where the animals were controlled and led through jobs such as winching and rodeo to be traded and harnessed once a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the plains of yesteryear there were no fences or limits between the herds or foundations and the only divisions that counted were natural ones such as rivers or streams. The savannah was considered the property of everyone and you could own the cattle, but not the land.</p>",

At the same time, many animals had returned to their wild state, thus appearing the bighorn cattle that occupied the savannah and that whoever domesticated and later marked could consider their property. This was, in elementary terms, one of the &quot;Laws of the Plain&quot;, according to which the land belonged to everyone and the free cattle could be taken by whoever had the ability to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">While livestock was consolidating as the predominant commercial activity, an enormous cultural change occurred between the early colonization of the 16th century and the rise of livestock at the end of the 17th century, represented by the processes and conflicts that resulted in the strong integration of the cultures of various indigenous groups with the cultural expressions of the new settlers from the interior of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Music, and especially song, turned out to be the common denominator of all the groups involved in the colonization of the Eastern Plains. When, for example, the Society of Jesus arrived in the region in the seventeenth century with intentions of acculturation and evangelization, its main tool to gain the confidence of the inhabitants of the region was the establishment of music schools in which even to make the instruments themselves - taking advantage of the artisan inclination of almost all the llaneros - and then go on to play and sing Christian hymns with their accompaniment.</p>",

In some of the work songs that can still be heard, it is possible to detect melodies similar to the songs of indigenous groups such as the Sikuani, which were sung in the plains since time immemorial. With the arrival of the first Europeans came the Andalusian melismas that had distant origins in refined Arab songs and also the first instruments such as vihuelas, small guitars that would end up becoming enormously popular throughout the region and that even used to accompany the muleteers on their journeys. as recently as the middle of the 19th century. But perhaps the most important instrument was one that the Jesuits introduced and without which llanera music is inconceivable: the harp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Jesuits managed to spread music to such a degree among the indigenous and Creole population that after their expulsion in 1767 the music never stopped and the manufacture of instruments became an important artisan work in the region. Absent the priests, the melodies of their hymns were slowly transforming - even in the absence of instruments, since many songs, including work songs, are sung a cappella that told proverbs, sayings and stories about the life of the plains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The plains have changed a lot and today they continue to change day by day, but the beautiful sound typical of the region -manifested not only in the music but also in the natural sounds, the japeos and whistles, the a cappella songs and the sounds of work- it has remained a strong constant. The work songs emerged as the most essential and unadorned manifestation of that mestizo atmosphere in which music has always been a precondition for being able to be part of social life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The work songs, which were not accompanied by instrumental music, were strongly attached to the sounds and vocabulary of the llaneros chores, they were positioned as the most primordial of musical expressions, the product of a vital impulse linked to work, to life in the immensity of the savannas and the oral tradition of a group of dissimilar cultures that finally, despite their differences, found a meeting point in an immense shared territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However, this harmony is seriously threatened and with it the work songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The reason why cattle are no longer sung in the plains is clear from the total change that has occurred in the plains world that gave rise to them, since that world that overflowed with music of nature, which inspired countless poetic images about the immensity of the natural world and in which a particular vocabulary dedicated to livestock was used, sadly no longer exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Those who previously traveled the plains and sang to their cattle are already very old and having been stripped of their old way of life, they have also been stripped of all authority against the new economic, cultural and social order that has been superimposed on force. on which used to belong to them as llaneros.</p>",

However, it should be noted that, at Easter, mainly on Thursdays and Fridays, these tasks are suspended, since the grandparents of those times, who professed the Catholic faith, gave them to understand that, if these days milking is done, all the milk will turn into blood. On the other hand, this work is carried out by all the members of the family without any distinction of age or sex. The reason is clear, the women participate in the preparation of the cheese together with the girls of the house; While the men take care of the animals, the boy is dedicated to sending the calves to the milker (the father) and the latter in turn brings him closer to the cow so that she can release the milk, in addition to milking the animals, he had to sing softly to him the &quot;put on ... put on my cow.&quot; Another aspect that should be highlighted in this work at dawn is the &quot;hidden&quot; verses. These consisted of an exchange of words that took place between the calf and the milker, which consisted of the calf guessing the particular features of the cow, from the sung couplet that the milker improvised. In this way, the child responded with the exact name of the cow, without the danger of being wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The following verse is part of the composition of the Venezuelan Sim&oacute;n D&iacute;az, entitled: &ldquo;Canto de milde&ntilde;o&rdquo; 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Milking:</strong><br />\r\nUp there on that hill<br />\r\nI have a clear water well<br />\r\nWhere the Virgin is washed<br />\r\nHer little feet and her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Calf:</strong><br />\r\nWater cloud, water cloud, water cloud!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The division of labor is not absolute, but commonly the children take care of the calves - acting as calves - while the adults milk. With very tame cows the children have the opportunity to learn and practice milking. At the same time they intervene by linking, managing and arranging the calves; and, in the afternoons, herding pal mamanto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The 2015 Latin Grammy, the maestro Reynaldo Armas captures it in one of his songs entitled: &ldquo;When you are big&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">When you grow up, look at what I intend to give you<br />\r\na horse so that you learn to ride,<br />\r\nthat is gentle that does not need spurs<br />\r\nof good rein and that he attends by the muzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">You will have to choose size and color yourself<br />\r\nthat always shows a lot of grace when walking,<br />\r\nthat horse will be more than your mount<br />\r\nfaithful companion and a friend in particular.</p>",

And it is precisely in this place, where the man born in these lands sings to the cattle to be able to guide them to other herds or farms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although, this song is a connection of man with animals, and not an interpretation given after reading a music book or some manual for its respective realization. It should be understood that this way of singing arises through an improvised verse, which is not accompanied by any instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Also, this song is known as &quot;herding or cattle&quot;, this expression of the culture of the plain, appears in the context of plain work, which consists of being attentive to all activity with livestock. Furthermore, he is in charge of collecting and setting aside, to sell or to work in the corral where the cattle lots are located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&uml;The flat work is carried out twice a year, at the beginning and end of winter, in the months of April - May and November - December, and it is always necessary to have an organized group of workers. The plain works are under the direction of a foreman, saquero or commission agent, who designates the positions depending on whether it is work in the sheet or cattle drive; a caprestero, ear flaps, culateros, chocotero, caballicero, etc.&uml;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Going into details about each of these functions that the flatwork has, it can be implied in the first place, that the Culatero is the rider in charge of lowering the cattle, a different task from that of the winch, since it is pointing (guiding) the cattle to their destination. &quot;The butt&quot; has the task of not letting any animal remain from the herd. Other riders are the ear-eaters: their job consists of being aware of the sides of the livestock; they will not allow the cattle to disperse from the group, but they are in charge of the order to side and side of the cattle lot. For his part, the Caballicero, as his name indicates, is the one who is solely and exclusively responsible for taking care of the horses used in this demanding job, he will be in charge of leading the horses from the corral to the paddocks to graze, he checks them that they are not have slaughter (name that refers to the peeling on the back of the beasts, caused by sweat and implement) and is aware of bathing them in addition to checking the hooves of each of the horses. And finally, there is the Chocotero who was in charge of the details such as food, accommodation for the riders, etc., in the long journeys that were made when livestock were kept.</p>",

This song is particular, due to the fact that it is sung throughout the night and part of the morning, in addition to being very important in the tasks of the plain work. This song was sung when the herd of cattle reached a specific point, which was already prepared by &quot;el Chocotero.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In this way, the cattle were led to the corrals during the night, but there was a risk that they would fall asleep, and there the problem began. Any noise put these animals on alert, this event alarmed the cattle and they ran the risk of shuffling, that is, stampeding out, finished in their wake, with all the corrals that the herd had. Precisely, the caporal was in charge of delegating laborers or watchmen to take care of the cattle, and it was through the singing of the candle that the animals calmed down, preventing them from falling asleep, and then with some unexpected noise inside the corral they would wake up and leave terrified to the savannah.<br />\r\nIt should be clarified that there was not always a corral of passage, generally the horsemen surrounded the cattle lot, watching over them throughout the night between the humor of the horse and the sound of songs. Finally, the objective of this song was precisely to keep the cattle awake, awake, in that all the llaneros who carried out this type of work agree and in this way avoid a shuffle, a violent departure of the cattle at midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Between themselves they took turns working between the cousin and the early morning, that is to say, that at midnight they handed over the shift so that the second would take charge until the early morning of the day. As long as the cattle were kept awake, there was no possibility of wasting time in the early morning to fetch them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The following verses correspond to an example of candle singing, with them it will be possible to better understand the context and intention of these songs, since they contain a reality and a narrative of their own for these hours of the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">To the night watchman who does not sing he wins or shuffles<br />\r\nAnd he&#39;s going to come out with the tale that the devil was to blame.<br />\r\nDon&#39;t fuck around, wake up let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Japa vaca, japa bull, japa the bull paints&#39; o<br />\r\nThat we are dawning, let&#39;s go to town &#39;or<br />\r\nAaaaaaa, aaaaaa, aaaaaa<br />\r\nOuu! Haa! Ouuu!</p>",

It is about musically nostalgic and sentimental verses that have a slow beat where many times the best choirs of the joropo have emerged, it is a recognized and typical rhythm of the eastern plain, Unesco says (2018):<br />\r\n&ldquo;This is perfectly in tune with the dynamics of nature and the environment in this region. The songs narrate vicissitudes of the individual and collective life of the llaneros and are normally transmitted to children from their infancy &rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In other words, the inhabitants found in the Colombian-Venezuelan Orinoqu&iacute;a developed four types of Work Songs: Milking songs, Cabrester songs, Sail songs and Domestication songs (whistles, screams, calls, japeos ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">He explained the love they have for the work of plain singing in cattle, According to Quiceno (2018):<br />\r\n&ldquo;The songs are the way in which we llaneros learned to manage livestock, both in the milking pen and in large herds or rodeos. It is the manifestation with which we communicate with the animal, for example, in milking the cow learned to become familiar with our song, with the name we put it and in the herding, the animal responded to the song, obeying the voice of the caprestero , they recognize it &rdquo;.</p>",

This initiative was approved on January 8, 2014, and it states that the sail edges have <strong>&quot;a level of critical risk that cannot be mitigated&quot;</strong> and within their observations it is established that &quot;the sail edges are part of the memory of the inhabitants of the region. Currently, the presence of corrals and technical rooms do not make sailing activity necessary, therefore, it is considered that a memory work should be carried out on this type of song aimed at recording and disseminating it.</p>",

The term is born from the union of two Greek words: gastros (stomach) and nomos (knowledge). In a strict sense, its object is culinary art, the relationship between preparing, serving and consuming food. While Jean Anthelme says: &ldquo;Gastronomy is a knowledge, an understanding, especially what has to do with food. Its objective is to ensure the survival of humanity thanks to a tasty and adequate diet &rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gastronomic culture.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Ministry of Culture of Colombia, &Aacute;ngela Caro recognizes that gastronomic culture is the ingenuity, knowledge and flavor of cooks who make the past dialogue with the present, recreating preparations whose origin is lost in time and merging them with new knowledge, because traditional cuisine as a cultural manifestation is dynamic and evolves day by day. Likewise, In the work of Leyva and G&oacute;mez (as he quotes Sonia Montecino (2009) &quot;cuisine and culture may well be synonymous. Understood as language, the web of human nutrition throws us into a dense matter in which the body, the Techniques and symbols intertwine to produce a warp in different societies. This author proposes us to see society through a fundamental activity, such as food, and how it creates a set of unique characteristics linked to the way to organize and prepare food&quot;.</p>",

                                    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a region, with the exception of the culinary customs of the indigenous people, the gastronomy usually has different flavors in the same dish. The sweet and sour, bittersweet, spicy and acid flavors predominate by the combination of fruits with meats, pisillos (combination of beef, pork, chicken, chig&uuml;iro and mamona), herbs, seeds, sauces, broths and various kinds of chili. The contrasts in the food that balance the flavors and effects are very prominent, both in the indigenous peoples and in the rest of the inhabitants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An example of the above is the case of coca, conceived as a vehicle of heat that, combined with something cold and pacifying like tobacco, manages to maintain balance to acquire &quot;the power of the word.&quot; The foregoing also applies to the case of seeds, fruits, legumes and meats that, mixed with seasonings such as chili pepper and salt, acquire not only a different flavor, but also new meanings in the culinary world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The indigenous peoples of the Orinoco and the Colombian Amazon classify food according to appearance, taste and texture; This is the case of hard and soft foods: the former associated with the masculine, such as cassava, due to their hardness and rigidity, and the latter, feminine, such as fari&ntilde;a, casabe or manioc, the result of the preparation of cassava to be consumed. In this last aspect, the fact of passing through female hands for consumption is striking. The sweet and the strong do not exactly refer to the flavors, but it has a more symbolic connotation because it relates the sweet with something calm and good. In the same way, strong is related to bravery and pain. For the natives, the cultivated plants are sweet (sajari) and are identified as female labor and the animals that come from hunting and fishing are strong (junirise), seen as male labor. That feminine side in the regions of the Amazon and the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a is the largest producer of food, since it is women who are the &quot;mothers of food&quot; who maintain the cultivation of products such as yucca, pineapple, yam, chontaduro, caimarona grape, among others. . It is the space of relationship with spiritual beings and also with other groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In some places in this region, the cuisine continues to represent culture and tradition, being very peasant and ancestral; However, a good part of this has been affected by globalization, a situation that is reflected in the presence of chemicals in food, hormones, artificial flavors, synthetic or industrialized wines. Eating habits are believed to be one of the most resistant cultural aspects to changing the acculturation process, because that knowledge becomes a form of cultural identity, which shows that the act of eating is not exclusively a biological and nutritional phenomenon, it is also a social expression of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An example of this is the comparison between the culinary traditions of the city man with those of the peasant. The vigor and resistance of the men of rural life, to face the attacks of the environment is greater, compared with that of the city man who consumes junk food, precooked and canned, among others. In a generalized way, the inhabitants of the southeast of the country consume vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and meats, components of a balanced diet, in addition to having a good physical activity due to their hunting, planting, fishing and livestock activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Orinoqu&iacute;a, soups, boiled and sancochos accompanied by a main dish such as fish meat and pisillos, as well as delicate desserts, sponges and jellies, make up a plains menu par excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a llanero is, it is the gastronomy of the region; bittersweet, spicy, intoxicating, strong and well &quot;trancao&quot; for the &quot;parrando&quot;. It&#39;s like a shot of Majule (a highly intoxicating fermented drink) or like a red-hot stove. The Venezuelan writer R&oacute;mulo Gallegos already expressed it in his novel Do&ntilde;a B&aacute;rbara: The plain goes crazy and the madness of the man of the wide and free land is always to be a ranger ... At work: taming and browsing, which are not jobs, but recklessness ; at rest: the plain in the malice of the &quot;chunk&quot;, in the beauty of the &quot;passage&quot;, in the sensual melancholy of the copla; in lazy abandonment: the immense land ahead and not walking, the horizon all open and looking for nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The unique llanera culture, halfway between the horse and the canoe, eats to live, but also lives to eat. Their activities are dominated by livestock, hunting and fishing influenced, most of the time, by the Amazon region from which they inherit a large amount of wild fruits, seeds and jungle plants.</p>",

The fondness for animals is inherited from the indigenous peoples, who obtained eggs or sometimes turtle meat for the Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">These parakeets can be accompanied with rice bread, a food that soaked in cereal and milk obtained from milking, generates rolls to accompany any meal, especially guarulo, a light coffee sweetened with panela that is taken in the morning. Fish broths or stews are essential when it comes to tasting a &ldquo;locked&rdquo; breakfast; However, in the region there is a very particular culinary tradition and they are the common &quot;pisillos&quot;. The &quot;pisillado&quot;, as it is known in the region, is nothing more than a mince of beef mainly, cut into thin strips, much desired by its inhabitants. There are fish as the main breakfast companion, along with a good portion of hogao and achiote oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With regard to the broths, the best &quot;raises the dead&quot; after a good &quot;parrando&quot; are the cachama head broths, which provide energy and hydrate the body. The cachama is the most widely consumed Amazonian fish in the plains region. The pioneers and kings of its preparation are in the galleras; When there are festivities or challenges, there is cachama soup for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">But the cachama is not the only king fish of the broths, you can also taste another &quot;raise the dead&quot; with the gamitana or tambaqu&iacute;, which competes with the cachama in size and quality; the latter wins for its reputation of being the most delicious in the region.</p>",

It has its origin in the economy, when in the past, in the large herds and social gatherings, the youngest animal was sacrificed because it was the least expensive; however, it had the best flavor and smooth texture for its tender meat. Cassava, banana and fruits in juice or pulp such as carambola, pineapple, chontaduro, copoazu, arara and apple-fruit, mainly, cannot be missing in a llanero barbecue. The types of cut of the mamona for the roast, vary between the ribs, the pulp meat and the meats of the shoulders that are seasoned, most of the time, with salt, beer and spices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Preparation is slow: three to four hours. Its success consists in avoiding the flames as much as possible and in not sucking the meats so that they do not lose their juices. These dishes are served with potato, banana, yucca, guacamole or hogao and are served on banana leaves.</p>",

Its origin comes from the indigenous Chiricoas, who consumed it as soup. It became an alcoholic beverage when it was fermented for several days, for which it was stigmatized for a long time because it is said that whoever drinks it goes out of control, causing the instability of the tribe and reaching extreme cases of murdering their own brothers. In moderation, like everything, it&#39;s actually a tasty, brotherly drink.

It is washed with a lot of water and left to rest for three days in clean water. The cassava skin is then scraped with a knife or machete until it is completely clean and washed. All the yuca is scratched until there is a dough of it and previously scratched yuca is added, that dough is left to rest for two days. Then it goes on to the squeezing process; This is done with the Sebuc&aacute;n (indigenous tool to squeeze), here it is squeezed out of all liquid and the yur&eacute; (poison). The resulting dry mass is extracted from the sebuc&aacute;n and with a mass or machuca stone until it is converted into flour. It is taken to the budare where it will be left for about an hour, during that period of time it must be stirring the flour at all times, after an hour of withdrawing from the budare and that granulated flour is ready to consume alone or as a companion.</p>",

This tradition, perhaps, is one of the most outstanding and unique, not only in the cuisine of the Orinoqu&iacute;a and the Amazon, but also in the world. It is a slow cooking process in which food is cooked in its own juices. The difference with other stoves is that it is cooked on the ground, after opening a hole of approximately 20cm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This technique uses the indirect heat of the fire to obtain a slow cooking process. In this way, the tatuco made up of fish or meat, cassava, banana, seasoned vegetables and the ingredients that the cook prefers is introduced, wrapped in bijao or banana leaves, tied with rope or rope. Then, the same earth that was removed is used to cover the hole and a bonfire is lit on top that will burn for approximately two hours. Once the tatuco is unearthed, it must be cleaned very well and served on fresh banana leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the end you get an exquisite meal. The previous one is one of the most impressive preparations, due to the journey and experience that is needed to open a hole in the ground, introduce a guadua log stuffed with chicken, fish or meat, cover it with banana leaves, light a bonfire and then dig it up for tasting.</p>",

These musical expressions developed during the colonial period with influences from Baroque music and inter-oceanic trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Until the middle of the 20th century, and as far as the plains region of Venezuela and the Eastern Plains of Colombia are concerned, the word joropo referred to a social event -almost a fair- lasting from a few hours to a whole week. People from the locality or people coming from various places, generally attracted by commercial exchange, participated in the event, where the central event was the music, the dance and the contrapunteos. The music of the joropo llanero was provided by a basic ensemble composed of harp, maracas and singing. If there was no harp, it was substituted by a bandola or violin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There is also an instrument, although it is on the way to extinction due to lack of players, such as the CIRRAMPLA, which in the time of the violence of the fifties was the only instrument used at night to lull the llaneros to sleep during those difficult times in the Colombian country.</p>",

Although the function of the furruco in the ensemble is rhythmic accompaniment, the fact that it always resonates the same low note generates a very interesting pedal sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">You may ask, how is the sound of a drum produced?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A drum is a percussion instrument with an indeterminate sound, belonging to the family of membranophones according to the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system. ... The sound is obtained by striking the instrument on the drumhead with the hand or with drumsticks. The snare is also usually percussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">How is the furruco made in the following way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The furruco is a membranophone formed by a cylindrical wooden body. It has a single goat leather drumhead on one of its sides which has a waxed reed attached to it. When rubbing this reed with the hands, the vibration is transferred to the drumhead producing a deep sound similar to the roar of an animal.</p>",

The number and type of mandolin strings has varied over time and place, but today the predominant configuration is that of the Neapolitan mandolin, with four double strings tuned like the violin (G-R-A-E).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The mandolin strings are usually plucked with a pick or plectrum, fingers may also be used. The soundboard may be concave or flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roots:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If you&#39;ve ever seen a country band playing live, you may have noticed someone playing what looks like a small guitar. That instrument is, in fact, a mandolin. The mandolin is a musical instrument in the lute family. It generally has four courses of double metal strings, for a total of eight strings, which are tuned in unison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Throughout the following millennia, this instrument would be called by many names, before being called the lute. This instrument traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East. In a 14th century painting, a miniature lute is depicted by an angel. This instrument is called the mandola, by the Latins. The Italians, on the other hand, called this instrument the mandolin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When European immigrants began arriving in North America in the 19th century, they brought the mandolin with them. Due to an interest in strange or exotic things, the mandolin became a popular instrument. The mandolin was popular during the 1850s as a novelty that entertained the middle class. In the late 19th century, there was a surge of Italian immigration that further popularized a version of the mandolin. this instrument would remain popular well into the 20th century, and at one point factories were mass producing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The mandolin in the 1940s</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">By the 1940s, the mandolin, along with the banjo and guitar, had become popular among middle-class youth on college campuses in the American South. During this time, musicians were more experimental in the way they used the instrument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As a result of this experimentation, new styles of playing emerged, some of which were influenced by techniques that are more closely related to the guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the llanera music has been making a comeback since some time ago, with some interpreters and due to its particular sonority.</p>",

It is located in the municipality of Tauramena, in the middle of the Colombian Orinoquia, a magical land, perfect to disconnect from the world. Here you live in the middle of the transition of two worlds, the plains and the mountains. This place is ideal for bird watching, hiking and exploring the wonders of nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Zambo waterfall is one of the most emblematic tourist attractions of Tauramena. Five vital ecosystems have been identified in this municipality, forests that protect fauna and water resources, and micro-watersheds that supply aqueducts. There are also the micro-watersheds of landscape incidence, wetlands and natural reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is a very visited site since it is relatively close to the urban area. The attractions of the site are, on the one hand, trekking to reach the Zambo waterfall and, on the other hand, the magnificent waterfall. For animal lovers, there is a great facility for wildlife watching. On the way to the waterfall you can enjoy the mountain and its landscape. There, the water springs in such a natural way that it bewilders and enchants.</p>",

These imposing mountains are formed by soil bearings that gave rise to denuded hills, which formed the hills of San Miguel de Farallones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Farallones de San Miguel, the vegetation corresponds to premontane rainforests and tropical forests. These two have a vital environmental value for the conservation of the natural balance of the ecosystem. In addition, there are springs and numerous bodies of water that feed the savannah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In addition, these mountains are natural reserves that serve as habitat for numerous species of flora and fauna in transition between the mountains and the plains. In total, the Farallones de San Miguel has an area of 3,400 hectares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">First and foremost, Los Farallones de San Miguel is a protected area, oriented to contemplation. It is also intended for the recovery of flora and wildlife, and as an area that produces water and captures greenhouse gases.</p>",

The main tributaries of the Ariporo and Guachiria rivers are born there, among others; and these feed the complex of the floodable savannahs of the municipalities of Hato Corozal and Paz de Ariporo (middle basin of the Ariporo and Guachar&iacute;a rivers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The ecosystems present in Zamaricote Hill provide services to small and medium producers in the municipalities of Paz de Ariporo, Pore and T&aacute;mara, through the supply and regulation of water essential for irrigation, watering places and domestic consumption. Due to its location, it is decisive for the genetic exchange of flora and fauna between the savannah and the Andean zone given its location in the foothills. It is also an important carbon sink since it preserves a representative sample of forest ecosystems in a good state of conservation. On the other hand, given its environmental offer, Zamaricote hill becomes a strategic place for research, wildlife preservation, forest conservation and sustainable productive actions that contribute to improving the quality of life of its inhabitants.</p>",

This is due to its decisive role as a production and water recharge area for the Cusiana, Unete Chiquito and Seco rivers. A large number of tributaries originate there, such as the Aguablanca, Cacaguala, Ca&ntilde;o Rico, Par&aacute;sitos and Manoqu&iacute;a streams. In addition, the Los Algarrobos and El Recodo streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Another reason for the importance of the Farallones de San Miguel is that it is home to a large endemic fauna with an endangered species warning. Some of these species are the white-tailed deer, the chig&uuml;iro, the macaw, the armadillo or cachicamo. In addition to the charapa turtle, the llanero caiman, the water mouse, as well as different species of bats. Among the reptiles, the populations of crocodiles, babillas, babas, turtles, iguanas and lizards stand out. You can also see lizards, boas and a large number of venomous snakes.</p>",

In the department of Casanare we find the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) that can measure 1.5 to 2 meters including the tail, its fur is dark brown and has yellowish spots on the neck that differ from one individual to another; and the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) that measures approximately between 90 cm and 1.40 meters whose fur is cinnamon brown to grayish brown with lighter spots on the belly and neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Habitat and Reproduction: These mammals have preferably clear bodies of water as their habitat, although they have also been observed in bodies of water with more sediment. Their gestation period can vary from 56 to 86 days according to research reports and observations in zoos; the number of offspring per birth can be from 1 to 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Importance:</strong> Considering the current transformation of aquatic ecosystems, otters become bio-indicators to monitor the ecological functionality of ecosystems, as they are animals that apparently inhabit little intervened water bodies.</p>",
