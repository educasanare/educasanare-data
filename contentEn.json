The joropo encloses in the fandango its Afro-American origin with small indigenous contributions. The first fandangos arrived in Caracas at the beginning of the seventeenth century, they were played in the evenings of the great cacaos in the capital&#39;s haciendas and were performed with instruments such as the bandurria, the instrument, the harpsichord and the bandola.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Etymology:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &quot;joropo&quot; comes from the Arabic &quot;xarop&quot; which means &quot;syrup&quot; and is related to the Mexican syrups from Guadalajara. There are those who say that the joropo is a Caribbean voice; likewise, there are people who maintain that it comes from Quechua.</p>",

Then in Egypt in a wall painting in the tomb of Nakht, Theban necropolis, New Kingdom, 1425-1405 BC. Arched, it first appears without a column. Its small number of strings is variable. Still in use in Africa, the bowed harp has undergone many evolutions and improvements over the centuries, thanks to the many civilizations that have practiced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe origin of the llanera harp dates back to the Jesuit religious who contributed extensively to the implementation of the harp in religious services, who brought the instrument from Spain, but over the years, it began to be manufactured in this place for the convenience of the musicians. In the first instance, the harp was an instrument used in churches and for private concerts in the houses of the rulers. Thanks to the Jesuits themselves, they decided to teach music to their congregants. The harp spread to the plains areas.</p>",

It is a plucked chordophone consisting of four strings. This is variety of the archaic four-stringed vihuela or Latin guitar, but in a larger box. It is traditionally used in joropos, passages and llanero airs instead of the current harp, since the classic organology of the llaneros was composed by bandola, cuatro and capachos. According to Carlos Rojas, the bandola llanera is a melodic guitar with four strings, two of which (the third and fourth) are made of metal and the other two of nylon. With a flat back and pear-shaped, traditional models have a short neck or fingerboard with only seven frets; modern versions, while maintaining the short neck design, present, in the manner of the Spanish guitar, frets embedded on an extension of the fingerboard on the soundboard. It is played with plectrum or pajuela, held between the thumb and index finger, combined in some segments of the piece with very percussive plucking of the first string called jalaos, made with the nail of the middle or ring finger and that are a form of response to the bordoneos (melodic songs implemented in the low register). Other common forms of execution are the segundeo (descending rasgueos) and the trapeo (rasgueos asordinados). The new generations of bandolistas also use melodic ornamentations such as the trill (tr&eacute;molo) sometimes played over the whole group of strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This type of archaic Hispanic lute, whose history in the llanera region is unfortunately very little documented, was rescued from an almost extinct tradition around the middle of the 20th century and has reached in recent years a remarkable virtuosic development that has led it to become the only melodic guitar in live use in the current joropo. It is a consubstantial instrument of the &quot;recio&quot; style joropo (with an accelerated tempo and great rhythmic vivacity), and is used in the interpretation of &quot;golpe&quot; and &quot;pasaje&quot;.</p>",

Its peculiar tuning is not totally ascending, it is small in size and owes its name to the number of strings it has. It should not be confused with the current Puerto Rican cuatro of five orders and ten metallic strings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Roots:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It has very remote origins. Similar instruments appear in Iranian and Cretan engravings in ovoid and square shape. In the year 3.000&amp; B.C., similar instruments are found in Egypt, derived from Chaldean-Assyrian instruments. The Arab lute or thimphle, through the Moorish invasions, arrived in Spain at the beginning of the 16th century with four orders, where it adopted a new shape, less oval and more similar to the current one, in the shape of an &quot;eight&quot;. Later, Maestro Salinas -Maestro de capilla of the Catholic Monarchs- added the fifth string and Vicente Espinel -who established the current strophic form of the tenth string- added the sixth string at the beginning of the XVII century (known as bordon or espinela) giving origin to the Guitar. The lute arrived in the Canary Islands, until it became the timple. This would be exported to America and the Caribbean with the Conquest of America, giving rise, many years later, to the versions known today in South America. The Puerto Rican cuatro, however, bears more resemblance to its ancestor the lute than to the timple of the Canary Islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nAlso known as the cuatro llanero or traditional cuatro, it is an inseparable part of typical llanera music ensembles, along with the llanera harp (or bandola, as the case may be). It usually has an accompaniment function, although it can also occupy a soloist position, as a concert instrument, in some cases (usually outside the scope of the aforementioned llanera music).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">It is normally played strumming the strings with the right hand and making the chords with the left hand. The standard tuning does not allow many exits from this scheme, so sometimes it is necessary to change the tuning to reach new melodic possibilities, as in the case of the cuatro soloist.</p>",

In the Llanos they are used as accompaniment to the harp and the cuatro in joropo ensembles. The player is known as maraquero. Despite the simplicity of the instrument, the maracas llaneras have achieved an impressive technique of syncopations and contratiempos at high speed. In some regions the player also sings.</p>",

In some cases and when a musical arrangement is established as a group or by the bass player&#39;s initiative, the bass can also function melodically in coherence with the main melody, playing a very important role for the musical group.</p>",

The songs announced respect for nature, at the same time as the triumph over the difficulties of livestock life. To these satisfied<br />\r\nSongs of &quot;herding&quot; or &quot;cabrestero&quot; were added others such as those of &quot;candle&quot; that were sung during the nights to keep calm the cattle that used to get nervous when the rain fell on the plain and the thunder was heard.</p>",

This factor of orality will account for the immaterial wealth that throughout history the grandparents have bequeathed to the men born in these lands. In this way, an experience is formalized in a radical way through the experiences of a true llanero. This oral tradition has been expressed in many ways, whether through legends, myths, mystery stories, or anecdotal events.<br />\r\nLlano work songs are vital to characterize the llanero man in his behavior, his way of relating to nature, with others and with the transcendent. Due to the particularity of this tradition of the plain work songs, the development of this peasant work has become an expression in danger of extinction like many species of animals, because with the passage of time, it has been drastically confronted with the progress of industry, machines, technology, etc., resulting in the weakening of this tradition.<br />\r\nHowever, for some llaneros this has not been an impediment in their being and daily work, because their work, be it that of a milker, a cabrester, even that of a calf (children who begin with this traditional milking trade) have symbolized their reason for being, rooted in the customs and traditions of their ancestors.</p>",

One of the biggest changes that occurred in the plains landscape, due to the promotion of the colonization of the region, was the opening of very extensive trails through which muleteers began to travel who risked their lives transporting, through treacherous and slippery roads. The cattle trails thus became the first commercial route that linked the prosperous and urban area of ​​the altiplano with eastern Colombia.<br />\r\nDuring the sixteenth century and well into the eighteenth, livestock farming that was practiced in the plains was extensive, which means that it was based on the use by cattle of vast areas of the plains that were used as a common good and in where the animals were controlled and led through jobs such as winching and rodeo to be traded and harnessed once a year.<br />\r\nIn the plains of yesteryear there were no fences or limits between the herds or foundations and the only divisions that counted were natural ones such as rivers or streams.

At the same time, many animals had returned to their wild state, thus appearing the bighorn cattle that occupied the savannah and that whoever domesticated and later marked could consider their property. This was, in elementary terms, one of the &quot;Laws of the Plain&quot;, according to which the land belonged to everyone and the free cattle could be taken by whoever had the ability to do so.<br />\r\nWhile livestock was consolidating as the predominant commercial activity, an enormous cultural change occurred between the early colonization of the 16th century and the rise of livestock at the end of the 17th century, represented by the processes and conflicts that resulted in the strong integration of the cultures of various indigenous groups with the cultural expressions of the new settlers from the interior of the country.<br />\r\nMusic, and especially song, turned out to be the common denominator of all the groups involved in the colonization of the Eastern Plains. When, for example, the Society of Jesus arrived in the region in the seventeenth century with intentions of acculturation and evangelization, its main tool to gain the confidence of the inhabitants of the region was the establishment of music schools in which even to make the instruments themselves - taking advantage of the artisan inclination of almost all the llaneros - and then go on to play and sing Christian hymns with their accompaniment.</p>",

In some of the work songs that can still be heard, it is possible to detect melodies similar to the songs of indigenous groups such as the Sikuani, which were sung in the plains since time immemorial. With the arrival of the first Europeans came the Andalusian melismas that had distant origins in refined Arab songs and also the first instruments such as vihuelas, small guitars that would end up becoming enormously popular throughout the region and that even used to accompany the muleteers on their journeys. as recently as the middle of the 19th century. But perhaps the most important instrument was one that the Jesuits introduced and without which llanera music is inconceivable: the harp.<br />\r\nThe Jesuits managed to spread music to such a degree among the indigenous and Creole population that after their expulsion in 1767 the music never stopped and the manufacture of instruments became an important artisan work in the region. Absent the priests, the melodies of their hymns were slowly transforming - even in the absence of instruments, since many songs, including work songs, are sung a cappella that told proverbs, sayings and stories about the life of the plains.<br />\r\nThe plains have changed a lot and today they continue to change day by day, but the beautiful sound typical of the region -manifested not only in the music but also in the natural sounds, the japeos and whistles, the a cappella songs and the sounds of work- it has remained a strong constant. The work songs emerged as the most essential and unadorned manifestation of that mestizo atmosphere in which music has always been a precondition for being able to be part of social life.<br />\r\nThe work songs, which were not accompanied by instrumental music, were strongly attached to the sounds and vocabulary of the llaneros chores, they were positioned as the most primordial of musical expressions, the product of a vital impulse linked to work, to life in the immensity of the savannas and the oral tradition of a group of dissimilar cultures that finally, despite their differences, found a meeting point in an immense shared territory.<br />\r\nHowever, this harmony is seriously threatened and with it the work songs.<br />\r\nThe reason why cattle are no longer sung in the plains is clear from the total change that has occurred in the plains world that gave rise to them, since that world that overflowed with music of nature, which inspired countless poetic images about the immensity of the natural world and in which a particular vocabulary dedicated to livestock was used, sadly no longer exists.<br />\r\nThose who previously traveled the plains and sang to their cattle are already very old and having been stripped of their old way of life, they have also been stripped of all authority against the new economic, cultural and social order that has been superimposed on force. on which used to belong to them as llaneros.</p>",

However, it should be noted that, at Easter, mainly on Thursdays and Fridays, these tasks are suspended, since the grandparents of those times, who professed the Catholic faith, gave them to understand that, if these days milking is done, all the milk will turn into blood. On the other hand, this work is carried out by all the members of the family without any distinction of age or sex. The reason is clear, the women participate in the preparation of the cheese together with the girls of the house; While the men take care of the animals, the boy is dedicated to sending the calves to the milker (the father) and the latter in turn brings him closer to the cow so that she can release the milk, in addition to milking the animals, he had to sing softly to him the &quot;put on ... put on my cow.&quot; Another aspect that should be highlighted in this work at dawn is the &quot;hidden&quot; verses. These consisted of an exchange of words that took place between the calf and the milker, which consisted of the calf guessing the particular features of the cow, from the sung couplet that the milker improvised. In this way, the child responded with the exact name of the cow, without the danger of being wrong.<br />\r\nThe following verse is part of the composition of the Venezuelan Sim&oacute;n D&iacute;az, entitled: &ldquo;Canto de milde&ntilde;o&rdquo; 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Milking:</strong><br />\r\nUp there on that hill<br />\r\nI have a clear water well<br />\r\nWhere the Virgin is washed<br />\r\nHer little feet and her face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Calf:</strong><br />\r\nWater cloud, water cloud, water cloud!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The division of labor is not absolute, but commonly the children take care of the calves - acting as calves - while the adults milk. With very tame cows the children have the opportunity to learn and practice milking. At the same time they intervene by linking, managing and arranging the calves; and, in the afternoons, herding pal mamanto.<br />\r\nThe 2015 Latin Grammy, the maestro Reynaldo Armas captures it in one of his songs entitled: &ldquo;When you are big&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">When you grow up, look at what I intend to give you<br />\r\na horse so that you learn to ride,<br />\r\nthat is gentle that does not need spurs<br />\r\nof good rein and that he attends by the muzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">You will have to choose size and color yourself<br />\r\nthat always shows a lot of grace when walking,<br />\r\nthat horse will be more than your mount<br />\r\nfaithful companion and a friend in particular.</p>",

And it is precisely in this place, where the man born in these lands sings to the cattle to be able to guide them to other herds or farms.<br />\r\nAlthough, this song is a connection of man with animals, and not an interpretation given after reading a music book or some manual for its respective realization. It should be understood that this way of singing arises through an improvised verse, which is not accompanied by any instrument.<br />\r\nAlso, this song is known as &quot;herding or cattle&quot;, this expression of the culture of the plain, appears in the context of plain work, which consists of being attentive to all activity with livestock. Furthermore, he is in charge of collecting and setting aside, to sell or to work in the corral where the cattle lots are located.<br />\r\n&uml;The flat work is carried out twice a year, at the beginning and end of winter, in the months of April - May and November - December, and it is always necessary to have an organized group of workers. The plain works are under the direction of a foreman, saquero or commission agent, who designates the positions depending on whether it is work in the sheet or cattle drive; a caprestero, ear flaps, culateros, chocotero, caballicero, etc.&uml;<br />\r\nGoing into details about each of these functions that the flatwork has, it can be implied in the first place, that the Culatero is the rider in charge of lowering the cattle, a different task from that of the winch, since it is pointing (guiding) the cattle to their destination. &quot;The butt&quot; has the task of not letting any animal remain from the herd. Other riders are the ear-eaters: their job consists of being aware of the sides of the livestock; they will not allow the cattle to disperse from the group, but they are in charge of the order to side and side of the cattle lot. For his part, the Caballicero, as his name indicates, is the one who is solely and exclusively responsible for taking care of the horses used in this demanding job, he will be in charge of leading the horses from the corral to the paddocks to graze, he checks them that they are not have slaughter (name that refers to the peeling on the back of the beasts, caused by sweat and implement) and is aware of bathing them in addition to checking the hooves of each of the horses. And finally, there is the Chocotero who was in charge of the details such as food, accommodation for the riders, etc., in the long journeys that were made when livestock were kept.</p>",

This song is particular, due to the fact that it is sung throughout the night and part of the morning, in addition to being very important in the tasks of the plain work. This song was sung when the herd of cattle reached a specific point, which was already prepared by &quot;el Chocotero.&quot;<br />\r\nIn this way, the cattle were led to the corrals during the night, but there was a risk that they would fall asleep, and there the problem began. Any noise put these animals on alert, this event alarmed the cattle and they ran the risk of shuffling, that is, stampeding out, finished in their wake, with all the corrals that the herd had. Precisely, the caporal was in charge of delegating laborers or watchmen to take care of the cattle, and it was through the singing of the candle that the animals calmed down, preventing them from falling asleep, and then with some unexpected noise inside the corral they would wake up and leave terrified to the savannah.<br />\r\nIt should be clarified that there was not always a corral of passage, generally the horsemen surrounded the cattle lot, watching over them throughout the night between the humor of the horse and the sound of songs. Finally, the objective of this song was precisely to keep the cattle awake, awake, in that all the llaneros who carried out this type of work agree and in this way avoid a shuffle, a violent departure of the cattle at midnight.<br />\r\nBetween themselves they took turns working between the cousin and the early morning, that is to say, that at midnight they handed over the shift so that the second would take charge until the early morning of the day. As long as the cattle were kept awake, there was no possibility of wasting time in the early morning to fetch them.<br />\r\nThe following verses correspond to an example of candle singing, with them it will be possible to better understand the context and intention of these songs, since they contain a reality and a narrative of their own for these hours of the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">To the night watchman who does not sing he wins or shuffles<br />\r\nAnd he&#39;s going to come out with the tale that the devil was to blame.<br />\r\nDon&#39;t fuck around, wake up let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">Japa vaca, japa bull, japa the bull paints&#39; o<br />\r\nThat we are dawning, let&#39;s go to town &#39;or<br />\r\nAaaaaaa, aaaaaa, aaaaaa<br />\r\nOuu!

This heritage includes ancient knowledge and knowledge, whose origin is lost in the memory of the peoples, since it implies practices, rituals and conceptions of the world with values ​​and symbols that have passed from one town to another and from one generation to another. In the course of history, they have been transformed, re-interpreted and re-created in a collective process, in accordance with the vicissitudes suffered in the natural and social environment.<br />\r\nIn other words, intangible heritage are all those intangible aspects that have an important value for a community and that for this reason must be recovered and must not be lost, in a certain way it is the representation that comes from antiquity, which represents a locality as such.<br />\r\n<strong>Unesco.</strong><br />\r\nUnited Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture UNESCO was created in 1945 to respond to the firm idea of ​​nations, since the agreements they had 24 were not enough to build a lasting peace where new policies were needed to govern for the good of communities, According to Unesco, World Heritage (2018): That there is intercultural understanding Through the protection of heritage and support for cultural diversity. UNESCO created the concept of &#39;World Heritage&#39; to protect places of exceptional universal value.

It is about musically nostalgic and sentimental verses that have a slow beat where many times the best choirs of the joropo have emerged, it is a recognized and typical rhythm of the eastern plain, Unesco says (2018):<br />\r\n&ldquo;This is perfectly in tune with the dynamics of nature and the environment in this region. The songs narrate vicissitudes of the individual and collective life of the llaneros and are normally transmitted to children from their infancy &rdquo;.<br />\r\nIn other words, the inhabitants found in the Colombian-Venezuelan Orinoqu&iacute;a developed four types of Work Songs: Milking songs, Cabrester songs, Sail songs and Domestication songs (whistles, screams, calls, japeos ).<br />\r\nHe explained the love they have for the work of plain singing in cattle, According to Quiceno (2018):<br />\r\n&ldquo;The songs are the way in which we llaneros learned to manage livestock, both in the milking pen and in large herds or rodeos. It is the manifestation with which we communicate with the animal, for example, in milking the cow learned to become familiar with our song, with the name we put it and in the herding, the animal responded to the song, obeying the voice of the caprestero , they recognize it &rdquo;.</p>",

The term is born from the union of two Greek words: gastros (stomach) and nomos (knowledge). In a strict sense, its object is culinary art, the relationship between preparing, serving and consuming food. While Jean Anthelme says: &ldquo;Gastronomy is a knowledge, an understanding, especially what has to do with food. Its objective is to ensure the survival of humanity thanks to a tasty and adequate diet &rdquo;.<br />\r\n<strong>Gastronomic culture.</strong><br />\r\nIn the Ministry of Culture of Colombia, &Aacute;ngela Caro recognizes that gastronomic culture is the ingenuity, knowledge and flavor of cooks who make the past dialogue with the present, recreating preparations whose origin is lost in time and merging them with new knowledge, because traditional cuisine as a cultural manifestation is dynamic and evolves day by day. Likewise, In the work of Leyva and G&oacute;mez (as he quotes Sonia Montecino (2009) &quot;cuisine and culture may well be synonymous. Understood as language, the web of human nutrition throws us into a dense matter in which the body, the Techniques and symbols intertwine to produce a warp in different societies. This author proposes us to see society through a fundamental activity, such as food, and how it creates a set of unique characteristics linked to the way to organize and prepare food&quot;.</p>",

                                    "content": "<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a region, with the exception of the culinary customs of the indigenous people, the gastronomy usually has different flavors in the same dish. The sweet and sour, bittersweet, spicy and acid flavors predominate by the combination of fruits with meats, pisillos (combination of beef, pork, chicken, chig&uuml;iro and mamona), herbs, seeds, sauces, broths and various kinds of chili. The contrasts in the food that balance the flavors and effects are very prominent, both in the indigenous peoples and in the rest of the inhabitants.<br />\r\nAn example of the above is the case of coca, conceived as a vehicle of heat that, combined with something cold and pacifying like tobacco, manages to maintain balance to acquire &quot;the power of the word.&quot; The foregoing also applies to the case of seeds, fruits, legumes and meats that, mixed with seasonings such as chili pepper and salt, acquire not only a different flavor, but also new meanings in the culinary world.<br />\r\nThe indigenous peoples of the Orinoco and the Colombian Amazon classify food according to appearance, taste and texture; This is the case of hard and soft foods: the former associated with the masculine, such as cassava, due to their hardness and rigidity, and the latter, feminine, such as fari&ntilde;a, casabe or manioc, the result of the preparation of cassava to be consumed. In this last aspect, the fact of passing through female hands for consumption is striking. The sweet and the strong do not exactly refer to the flavors, but it has a more symbolic connotation because it relates the sweet with something calm and good. In the same way, strong is related to bravery and pain. For the natives, the cultivated plants are sweet (sajari) and are identified as female labor and the animals that come from hunting and fishing are strong (junirise), seen as male labor. That feminine side in the regions of the Amazon and the Colombian Orinoqu&iacute;a is the largest producer of food, since it is women who are the &quot;mothers of food&quot; who maintain the cultivation of products such as yucca, pineapple, yam, chontaduro, caimarona grape, among others. . It is the space of relationship with spiritual beings and also with other groups.<br />\r\nIn some places in this region, the cuisine continues to represent culture and tradition, being very peasant and ancestral; However, a good part of this has been affected by globalization, a situation that is reflected in the presence of chemicals in food, hormones, artificial flavors, synthetic or industrialized wines. Eating habits are believed to be one of the most resistant cultural aspects to changing the acculturation process, because that knowledge becomes a form of cultural identity, which shows that the act of eating is not exclusively a biological and nutritional phenomenon, it is also a social expression of culture.<br />\r\nAn example of this is the comparison between the culinary traditions of the city man with those of the peasant. The vigor and resistance of the men of rural life, to face the attacks of the environment is greater, compared with that of the city man who consumes junk food, precooked and canned, among others. In a generalized way, the inhabitants of the southeast of the country consume vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits and meats, components of a balanced diet, in addition to having a good physical activity due to their hunting, planting, fishing and livestock activities.<br />\r\nIn the Orinoqu&iacute;a, soups, boiled and sancochos accompanied by a main dish such as fish meat and pisillos, as well as delicate desserts, sponges and jellies, make up a plains menu par excellence.<br />\r\nAs a llanero is, it is the gastronomy of the region; bittersweet, spicy, intoxicating, strong and well &quot;trancao&quot; for the &quot;parrando&quot;. It&#39;s like a shot of Majule (a highly intoxicating fermented drink) or like a red-hot stove. The Venezuelan writer R&oacute;mulo Gallegos already expressed it in his novel Do&ntilde;a B&aacute;rbara: The plain goes crazy and the madness of the man of the wide and free land is always to be a ranger ... At work: taming and browsing, which are not jobs, but recklessness ; at rest: the plain in the malice of the &quot;chunk&quot;, in the beauty of the &quot;passage&quot;, in the sensual melancholy of the copla; in lazy abandonment: the immense land ahead and not walking, the horizon all open and looking for nothing.<br />\r\nThe unique llanera culture, halfway between the horse and the canoe, eats to live, but also lives to eat. Their activities are dominated by livestock, hunting and fishing influenced, most of the time, by the Amazon region from which they inherit a large amount of wild fruits, seeds and jungle plants.</p>",

The fondness for animals is inherited from the indigenous peoples, who obtained eggs or sometimes turtle meat for the Spanish.<br />\r\nThese parakeets can be accompanied with rice bread, a food that soaked in cereal and milk obtained from milking, generates rolls to accompany any meal, especially guarulo, a light coffee sweetened with panela that is taken in the morning. Fish broths or stews are essential when it comes to tasting a &ldquo;locked&rdquo; breakfast; However, in the region there is a very particular culinary tradition and they are the common &quot;pisillos&quot;. The &quot;pisillado&quot;, as it is known in the region, is nothing more than a mince of beef mainly, cut into thin strips, much desired by its inhabitants. There are fish as the main breakfast companion, along with a good portion of hogao and achiote oil.<br />\r\nWith regard to the broths, the best &quot;raises the dead&quot; after a good &quot;parrando&quot; are the cachama head broths, which provide energy and hydrate the body. The cachama is the most widely consumed Amazonian fish in the plains region. The pioneers and kings of its preparation are in the galleras; When there are festivities or challenges, there is cachama soup for everyone.<br />\r\nBut the cachama is not the only king fish of the broths, you can also taste another &quot;raise the dead&quot; with the gamitana or tambaqu&iacute;, which competes with the cachama in size and quality; the latter wins for its reputation of being the most delicious in the region.</p>",

It has its origin in the economy, when in the past, in the large herds and social gatherings, the youngest animal was sacrificed because it was the least expensive; however, it had the best flavor and smooth texture for its tender meat. Cassava, banana and fruits in juice or pulp such as carambola, pineapple, chontaduro, copoazu, arara and apple-fruit, mainly, cannot be missing in a llanero barbecue. The types of cut of the mamona for the roast, vary between the ribs, the pulp meat and the meats of the shoulders that are seasoned, most of the time, with salt, beer and spices.<br />\r\nPreparation is slow: three to four hours. Its success consists in avoiding the flames as much as possible and in not sucking the meats so that they do not lose their juices. These dishes are served with potato, banana, yucca, guacamole or hogao and are served on banana leaves.</p>",

It became an alcoholic beverage when it was fermented for several days, for which it was stigmatized for a long time because it is said that whoever drinks it goes out of control, causing the instability of the tribe and reaching extreme cases of murdering their own brothers. In moderation, like everything, it&#39;s actually a tasty, brotherly drink.

It is washed with a lot of water and left to rest for three days in clean water. The cassava skin is then scraped with a knife or machete until it is completely clean and washed. All the yuca is scratched until there is a dough of it and previously scratched yuca is added, that dough is left to rest for two days. Then it goes on to the squeezing process; This is done with the Sebuc&aacute;n (indigenous tool to squeeze), here it is squeezed out of all liquid and the yur&eacute; (poison). The resulting dry mass is extracted from the sebuc&aacute;n and with a mass or machuca stone until it is converted into flour. It is taken to the budare where it will be left for about an hour, during that period of time it must be stirring the flour at all times, after an hour of withdrawing from the budare and that granulated flour is ready to consume alone or as a companion.</p>",

It is a slow cooking process in which food is cooked in its own juices. The difference with other stoves is that it is cooked on the ground, after opening a hole of approximately 20cm.<br />\r\nThis technique uses the indirect heat of the fire to obtain a slow cooking process. In this way, the tatuco made up of fish or meat, cassava, banana, seasoned vegetables and the ingredients that the cook prefers is introduced, wrapped in bijao or banana leaves, tied with rope or rope. Then, the same earth that was removed is used to cover the hole and a bonfire is lit on top that will burn for approximately two hours. Once the tatuco is unearthed, it must be cleaned very well and served on fresh banana leaves.<br />\r\nIn the end you get an exquisite meal.
